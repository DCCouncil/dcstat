The Parkside\nParcel E and J Mixed-Income Apartments are part of a large, 15-acre mixed-use development\nproject in the Kenilworth-Parkside neighborhood of Ward 7. A tax abatement is necessary to\nfacilitate a speedy closing process in order to break ground on these buildings as soon as\npossible.

The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nParkside Parcel E and J Mixed-Income Apartments Tax Abatement Congressional Review\nEmergency Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
