Law 19-168; D.C.\nOfficial Code \u00a7 1-328.04) (\u201c2012 Act\u201d), included a provision authorizing the Deputy Mayor to\nmake a grant in the amount of $800,000 to the mixed-used development known as 4800 Nannie\nHelen Burroughs Avenue, N.E., in Ward 7, in order to make the affordable housing project\nviable.\n(c) It was later discovered that if the project were to receive the $800,000 grant, it\nwould no longer be eligible for certain tax credits and there would be a great tax penalty imposed\nupon the project.\n(d) A loan in the amount of $800,000 will allow the project to move forward\nwithout further delays or financial duress.\n(e) This emergency changes the language of the 2012 Act by simply changing the\noriginal grant to a loan and will serve the same purpose of assisting a mixed-use project that will\nprovide 70 units of affordable housing to the Deanwood community of Ward 7.\nSec. 3.
