(a) There exists an immediate need to approve Modification Nos. 12 and 13 to\nContract No. DCKA-2009-C-0123 with C&D Tree Services, Inc. (\u201cC&D\u201d) for tree removal\nservices provided to the District Department of Transportation (\u201cDDOT\u201d) and to authorize\npayment for services received and to be received under this contract.\n(b) On February 4, 2014, DDOT\u2019s Office of Contracting and Procurement (\u201cOCP\u201d)\npartially executed Option Year 4 from February 9, 2014, through March 10, 2014, for\n$400,000.00 for tree removal services.

This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-828\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
