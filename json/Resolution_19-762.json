Resolution 19-762, effective December 18, 2012\n\n20 DCSTAT 574\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed Resolution\n19-1184\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to order the closing of a portion of a\npublic alley in Square 393, bounded by Florida Avenue, N.W., 8th Street, N.W., and 9th Street,\nN.W., in Ward 1.\n\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C. Act 19-623\n20 DCSTAT 390\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cClosing of a Public Alley in Square 393, S.O. 11-08780,\nEmergency Declaration Resolution of 2012\".\n\nClosing of a Public\nAlley in Square 393,\nS.O. 11-08780,\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of 2012\n\nSec. 2. (a) The Council has considered on first reading on December 4, 2012, and\nfinal reading on December 18, 2012, Bill 19-787, the Closing of a Public Alley in Square 393,\nS.O. 11-08780, Act of 2012, following mark-up by the Committee of the Whole.\n(b) The alley closing legislation will facilitate the development of a residential building\nwith ground floor retail in Square 393. The alley closing requires the recordation of a covenant\nestablishing new portions of the alley system by easement as shown on the Surveyor\u2019s plat in\nS.O. 11-08780, and the applicant agrees to maintain the new portions of the alley system\nestablished by easement. The reconfigured alley system results in an improved alley system for\ntraffic flow through and around the square. In addition, this development will have a positive\nfiscal impact on the District of Columbia through the generation of substantial new property tax\nrevenues and new residential income tax, will provide affordable housing and will result in\nimportant streetscape improvements. The development will also create approximately 200 jobs\nduring construction and additional permanent jobs after completion of the project.\n(c) The Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1B (\u201cANC\u201d), the ANC within which the\nproject is located, unanimously voted to support the alley closing and the establishment of an\nalley easement.\n(d) Approval of emergency legislation will allow the construction of the proposed\ndevelopment to proceed expeditiously. Securing the alley closing approval is essential for the\napplicant to move forward in a timely manner with the development and is necessary for the\napplicant to obtain the required construction financing commitment.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Closing\nof a Public Alley in Square 393, S.O. 11-08780, Emergency Act of 2012 be adopted after a\nsingle reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
