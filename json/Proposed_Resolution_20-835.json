The regulation provides\nexceptions for private passenger vehicles, vehicles that are operating power takeoff equipment,\nand to allow idling for up to five (5) minutes when the temperatures are below thirty-two degrees\nFahrenheit (32\u00b0F).\n(c) When the District issues a \"Cold Emergency Alert,\" typically because forecasted\ntemperatures are below fifteen degrees Fahrenheit (15\u00b0F), HSEMA deploys warming buses\naround the District to provide shelter to the District's vulnerable population and protect them\nfrom the frigid cold and bracing wind.\n(d) The Department is adding a narrow exception to the engine idling restrictions so that\nthese warming buses can idle in excess of the five (5) minute restriction during extreme cold\ntemperatures and weather conditions in order to protect vulnerable individuals from cold- related\ndeath and injury.\n(e) On December 8, 2012, proposed regulations were published in the D.C.
