The Council finds that:\n(a) The District Department of the Environment is amending the District's regulation\ncontrolling engine idling (20 DCMR \u00a7 900.1) to add an exception for warming buses deployed\nby the District of Columbia Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency (HSEMA)\nin the event of a \"Cold Emergency Alert.\"\n(b) Currently, section 900.1 prohibits any vehicle from idling its engine for more than\nthree (3) minutes while the vehicle is parked, stopped, or standing. The regulation provides\nexceptions for private passenger vehicles, vehicles that are operating power takeoff equipment,\nand to allow idling for up to five (5) minutes when the temperatures are below thirty-two degrees\nFahrenheit (32\u00b0F).\n(c) When the District issues a \"Cold Emergency Alert,\" typically because forecasted\ntemperatures are below fifteen degrees Fahrenheit (15\u00b0F), HSEMA deploys warming buses\naround the District to provide shelter to the District's vulnerable population and protect them\nfrom the frigid cold and bracing wind.\n(d) The Department is adding a narrow exception to the engine idling restrictions so that\nthese warming buses can idle in excess of the five (5) minute restriction during extreme cold\ntemperatures and weather conditions in order to protect vulnerable individuals from cold- related\ndeath and injury.\n(e) On December 8, 2012, proposed regulations were published in the D.C. Register at\n59 DCR 14166. No comments were received at that time; however there were stakeholder\nrequests to extend the comment period. Therefore, on January 18, 2013, the Department\npublished a notice of extended comment period in the D. C. Register at 60 DCR 379. No\ncomments were received by the end of the extended comment period. However, after the\ncomment period, two comments were received, considered, and addressed in the final\nrulemaking.\n(f) The Department has also specified that priority should be given to clean fuel vehicles\nor, if those are not available, newer model year vehicles, in order to minimize vehicle emissions.\n(g) The Department has also specified that the buses should be located at least fifty feet\n(50 ft.) from residential buildings, in order to reduce concerns about odors.\n(h) These amendments were enacted as an emergency rulemaking on February 7, 2014,\nand an emergency and proposed rulemaking was published in the D.C.
