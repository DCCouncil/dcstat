To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence,\nsuch an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring\nupon the teacher's death if the benefit provided under this act does not charge the teacher for\nproviding a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined for purposes of section 415 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code) upon the teacher's death.\n\"(3) If the teacher has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit\nportion of this act (as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and associated\nregulations), the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this act and the denominator\nof which is 10. The adjustment in this paragraph shall not apply to benefits paid on account of\ndisability under section 4(d) or as a result of the death of a teacher under section 9.
