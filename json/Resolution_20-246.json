(a) There exists an immediate need to clarify the phrase \u201cmajor changes\u201d in\norder to resolve any confusion or concerns of the Fire and Emergency Medical Services\nDepartment (\u201cDepartment\u201d) regarding its ability to fill its funded vacancies and spend its\nallocated capital funds in order to provide fire and emergency medical services in the District of\nColumbia.\n(b) The phrase \u201cmajor changes\u201d was not intended to prevent the Department from\nutilizing its approved budget to fill vacancies, staff up paramedics as necessary, purchase\napparatus required to meet the needs of the District, and include those additions in its\ndeployment.\n(c) For the current fiscal year, the Mayor proposed, and the Council approved, an\noperating and capital budget for Fire & Emergency Medical Services that would meet the needs\nof the District with regard to fire suppression and emergency medical care. The Department\nsupported this budget and did not request additional resources.\n(d) For fiscal year 2014, the Mayor presented an operating and capital budget for Fire &\nEmergency Medical Services that was similar to the current fiscal year. The Department\nsupported this proposal and did not request additional resources. The Council approved a\nbudget that included additional resources for emergency medical services staffing and the\npurchase of additional apparatus.\n(e) The Department has continued to maintain a large percentage of vacancies in\noperations, and has failed to keep up with a fleet maintenance and replacement schedule.\nStaffing and purchasing apparatus at the level the Mayor and the Department identified as\nappropriate in the fiscal year 2013 and 2014 budget proposals would not be a \u201cmajor change.\u201d\nIt would, however, equip the Department to meet current service delivery needs.\n(f) Accordingly, the Department should not interpret \u201cmajor changes\u201d to prohibit the\nDepartment from filling those budgeted vacancies and purchasing those budgeted ambulances\nand then adding both to its deployment; provided, that there is no reduction or downgrade to the\nexisting deployment plan.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-390\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
