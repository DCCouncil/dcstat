Act 19-598\n20 DCSTAT 324\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cDistrict of Columbia Democratic State Committee Elections\nEmergency Declaration Resolution of 2012\u201d.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\nDemocratic State\nCommittee Elections\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of 2012\n\nSec. 2. (a) This emergency declaration resolution is necessary to require the District\nof Columbia Board of Elections (\"Board\") to schedule the election for District of Columbia\nDemocratic State Committee (\"Committee\") officials during the special election to fill the atlarge Council seat, which is to take place on April 23, 2013.\n(b) On August 26, 2011, the Committee notified the Board that due to the presidential\nelection of 2012, the Democratic National Committee had advised the Committee to avoid\nscheduling its election of party officials in the middle of the delegate selection process for the\n2012 Democratic National Convention.\n(c) The Committee advised the Board that it would elect its party officials through a State\nConvention instead of during the primary held on April 3, 2012; however, the election never\ntook place.\n(d) The Constitution of the Committee states that the election of the party officials must\nbe held at each primary election and makes no exceptions to how the party officials of the\nCommittee are elected.\n(e) The Committee requested that the Board hold an election for its party officials on\nNovember 6, 2012.\n(f) The Board notified the Committee that pursuant to section 10(a)(1) of the District of\nColumbia Election Code of 1955, approved August 12, 1955 (69 Stat. 702; D.C. Official Code \u00a7\n1-1001.10(a)(1)), elections of party officials can take place only on the 2nd Tuesday in February\nof each presidential election year or the 1st Tuesday in April of each presidential election year if\nthere is a primary election already scheduled for other purposes on the date requested.\n(g) According to the Board\u2019s determination, at this point an election of Committee\nofficials cannot be held until 2016.\n(h) The Committee has faced allegations of not being open and transparent with its\nproceedings.\n(i) All of the current party Committee officials have served beyond their expired terms. It\nwould be irresponsible to wait until 2016 to allow the over 300,000 registered Democrats in the\nDistrict of Columbia to vote for Committee party officials.\n(j) It would be more open, fair, and transparent to have the Board hold the election for the\nparty officials of the Committee during the special election to fill the at large Council seat on\nApril 23, 2013.\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 19-759, effective December 18, 2012\n\n20 DCSTAT 570\n\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the District\nof Columbia Democratic State Committee Elections Emergency Amendment Act of 2012 be\nadopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
