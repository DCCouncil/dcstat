Findings and policy.\n(a) It is the policy of the District government that there shall be an enduring, full-service\nhospital east of the Anacostia River. To effect this policy, the government is committed to\nimproving the United Medical Center (\u201cUMC\u201d) with the expectation that its improved financial\ncondition (i.e., solvency) will enable eventual divestiture of UMC from District ownership and\nmanagement.\n(b) The government recognizes and supports the proposition that maintaining full hospital\nservice may likely entail more than renovation of the current facility on Southern Avenue, S.E.\n(c) Substantial funding has been made available to UMC in the Capital Improvement\nPlan accompanying the Fiscal Year 2015 budget. Although most of these dollars are strategic\ninvestment in facilities, equipment, and information technology, the Council would be supportive\nof utilizing these dollars toward a viable proposal, which may involve a public-private\npartnership, to construct a new hospital facility rather than renovation of the existing facility.\n(d) The Council affirmatively approved a contract in 2012 with Huron Consulting Group\n(\u201cHuron\u201d) in part to improve the operations of UMC and to assist with the divestiture of UMC\nfrom District ownership and management. Huron is urged to solicit bidders for ownership and\nmanagement without constraint as to a particular business model or financing structure other\nthan to obtain an offer that is both in the best interest of the District government and the policy to\nmaintain an enduring, full-service hospital east of the Anacostia River.\n(e) The Executive is urged to move forward expeditiously with improving UMC\noperations and soliciting proposals for private sector takeover of the ownership and management\nof the United Medical Center.\nSUBTITLE Q.
