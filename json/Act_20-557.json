Act 20-557, effective December 30, 2014 (Expiration date March 30, 2015)\n\nAN ACT\n\nBill 20-1059\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nRes. 20-750\n20 DCStat 4666\n\nTo authorize, on an emergency basis, the Mayor to assemble the soccer stadium site including\nthrough the use of eminent domain, to require the Mayor to amend the ground lease of\nthe soccer stadium site, to require the Mayor to amend the development agreement for the\nconstruction of a new soccer stadium, and to authorize the rental of airspace and vault\nspace; to amend the Robert F.

ASSEMBLAGE OF SITE;\nAUTHORITY OF MAYOR TO EXERCISE EMINENT DOMAIN.\nSec. 101. Definitions.\nFor the purposes of this title, the term \u201csoccer stadium site\u201d means the real property\ndescribed as Squares 603S, 605, 607, 661, and 661N, and the northwest portion of Lot 24 in\nSquare 665 as described in the letter of intent between the District and Potomac Electric Power\nCompany dated December 27, 2013, and all public alleys and streets to be closed within these\nsquares.\nSec. 102. Findings.\nThe Council finds that:\n(1) RFK Stadium is no longer suitable as a home for D.C. United in that it was not\ndesigned to host soccer, but was designed for football and baseball, has a capacity much larger\nthan current Major League Soccer Stadiums, is more than 50 years old, is in deteriorating\ncondition, and is near the end of its useful life.\n(2) Without the development of a new soccer stadium, it is likely that D.C. United\nwould ultimately move to another jurisdiction where it could participate in the development of a\nmodern, state-of-the-art, outdoor soccer stadium, which would cause the District to lose the\neconomic and fiscal benefits associated with the team\u2019s location in the District.\n(3) The development and operation of a new, state-of-the-art, LEED certified\noutdoor soccer stadium at Buzzard Point and the planned development on its ancillary site will\n\nNote, New\n\u00a7 10-1603.01\n\nNote, New\n\u00a7 10-1603.02\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 4468\nD.C. Act 20-557, effective December 30, 2014 (Expiration date March 30, 2015)\n\nincrease economic activity.\n(4) The stadium is proposed to be located in Buzzard Point, an underutilized\nindustrial area that has long been targeted for redevelopment and, in anticipation of that\nredevelopment, has been rezoned for higher density use, but that, without a catalytic, publicsponsored project, is not likely to see significant redevelopment for a minimum of 8 years and\nlikely longer.\n(5) Developing a state-of-the-art, LEED certified outdoor soccer stadium at\nBuzzard Point will serve to accelerate that redevelopment as well as promote economic\ndevelopment in the Buzzard Point and Capitol Riverfront neighborhoods and enhance economic\nvitality in the District of Columbia.\n(6) Improvements in the physical environment of Buzzard Point catalyzed by the\nsoccer stadium will connect Buzzard Point to the emerging Capitol Riverfront area to create a\nvibrant, mixed-use neighborhood with improved pedestrian circulation and continuous public\naccess to the water, offer new development opportunities that could promote mixed-use\ndevelopment and increase the inventory of affordable housing through inclusionary zoning, and\nprovide ways to improve the environmental health of Buzzard Point.\n(7) Improvements and infrastructure investments represented by the development\nof a new, state-of-the-art soccer stadium project at Buzzard Point will leverage other nearby\nDistrict investments such as the South Capitol Street Bridge project and the parking facilities for\nNationals Park and, along with the successful and planned development at the Yards and the\nWharf, combine to anchor a new, mixed-use neighborhood that would reconnect residents to the\nwaterfront, enhance the natural environment, and establish an attractive gateway to the District\nwhile improving conditions for nearby residents.\nSec. 103. Assemblage of soccer stadium site.\n(a)(1) The Council disapproves the exchange agreement between the District of\nColumbia and SW Land Holder, LLC dated May 23, 2014 (the \u201cexchange agreement\u201d) and the\namendment to the exchange agreement dated October 7, 2014.\n(2) The Mayor shall acquire Squares 605, 607, and 661 and the northwest portion\nof Lot 24 in Square 665 as described in the letter of intent between the District and Potomac\nElectric Power Company (\u201cPEPCO\u201d) dated December 27, 2013 for market value at a cost not to\nexceed $88.9 million; provided, that the cost may exceed $88.9 million if in an eminent domain\nproceeding the court determines or an appraisal conducted by the District establishes a value for\none or more properties that causes the cost to exceed $88.9 million.\n(b) Notwithstanding An Act Authorizing the sale of certain real estate in the District of\nColumbia no longer required for public purposes, approved August 5, 1939 (53 Stat. 1211; D.C.\nOfficial Code \u00a7 10-801 et. seq.), or other provision of law, the Council authorizes the Mayor to\ntransfer Lot 82 in Square 559 to PEPCO in exchange for $15.8 million.\n(c) The Mayor is not authorized to exchange or otherwise dispose of the Franklin D.\nReeves Center, located on Lot 844 in Square 204, in conjunction with the assemblage of the\nsoccer stadium site.\n\nNote, New\n\u00a7 10-1603.03\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 4469\nD.C.
