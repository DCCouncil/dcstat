The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nOmnibus Criminal Code Amendments Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of\n2013 be adopted after a single reading.\n\nOmnibus\nCriminal\nCode\nAmendments\nCongressional\nReview\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.
