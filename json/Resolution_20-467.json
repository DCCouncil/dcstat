Resolution 20-467, effective May 6, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3408\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the District of Columbia\nWorkers' Compensation Act of 1979 to match federal statute of limitations for private-sector\nemployees who are injured at work.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Statute of Limitations Emergency\nDeclaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\nSec. 2. (a) Previously, under District law, a private-sector employee who was injured\non the job had only 6 months to file a lawsuit against the party responsible for the employee\u2019s\ninjury. After 6 months, the injured worker\u2019s rights to recover damages were automatically\nassigned to the employee\u2019s employer and its insurance company.\n(b) A 6-month time limit to file a lawsuit is often too short for District residents who are\ninjured on the job to investigate cases and respond to significant life issues following their atwork accidents. Moreover, the injured worker\u2019s employer and the employer\u2019s insurance\ncompany may not take action or have the interests of the injured worker in mind when doing so.\n(c) If an individual were injured in a District location other than a workplace, the\nindividual would have 3 years to file a lawsuit against the party responsible for the injury, as the\nstandard 3-year statute of limitations for negligence would apply.\n(d) The District\u2019s private-sector workers compensation statute, which was enacted in\n1979, was modeled on the federal Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\n(\u201cLHWCA\u201d).\n(e) In 1984, Congress changed the corresponding section of the LHWCA. Under\nfederal law, if an injured employee does not file a lawsuit within 6 months, the employee\u2019s\nrights to do so are still automatically assigned to the employee\u2019s employer and its insurance\ncompany; however, if the employer and its insurance company do not take action within 90\ndays, the right to sue automatically reverts back to the injured employee.\n(f) Although the District\u2019s private-sector workers compensation statute was modeled on\nthe LHWCA, the District statute was never amended to reflect the 1984 amendment to the\nLHWCA. Because of this, District residents who are injured on the job have only 6 months to\nfile a lawsuit, while residents who are injured outside of the workplace have 3 years to\ncommence legal action.\n(g) As a result of this inequity, the Council previously enacted emergency and\ntemporary legislation that amended the District\u2019s private-sector workers\u2019 compensation statute\nto match the federal law on which it was based. The emergency legislation has expired, and the\ntemporary will expire on May 30, 2014. Accordingly, this emergency legislation is necessary\nwhile permanent legislation is under review. Under this new emergency legislation, if an injured\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-767\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-334\n20 DCStat 3318\n\nWorkers\u2019\nCompensation\nStatute of\nLimitations\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-467, effective May 6, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3409\n\nemployee does not file a lawsuit against the party responsible for the employee\u2019s injury within 6\nmonths, the right to sue will still automatically transfer to the employee\u2019s employer and its\ninsurance company; however, as under federal law, if the employer and its insurance company\ndo not take action within 90 days, the right to sue will revert back to the injured employee, and\nthe District\u2019s standard 3-year statute of limitations will apply.\n(h) In addition to matching federal law, this legislation would make the District\u2019s statute\nof limitations for injured workers similar to laws in neighboring jurisdictions. In Maryland, the\nstatute of limitations for injured workers to file suit is 3 years. In Virginia, the statute of\nlimitations is 2 years.\n(i) This emergency legislation is necessary to provide a fair opportunity for injured\nemployees to recover damages for injuries that they have received.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the\ncircumstances enumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary\nthat the\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Statute of Limitations Emergency Amendment Act of 2014 be adopted\nafter a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
