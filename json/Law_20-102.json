Findings.\nThe Council finds that:\n(1) Global climate change has increased the frequency and severity of destructive\nweather patterns. Accordingly, electric power distribution service in the District of Columbia is\nvulnerable to equipment failures on the overhead electric distribution system of the electric\ncompany for many reasons, including high winds, flooding, lightning strikes, snow and ice\naccumulations, foreign contact between overhead equipment and animals, trees, and other objects,\nand other causes. In the past, this damage has caused the loss of electric power over extended time\nperiods to residential and commercial customers; which damage and power loss have created\neconomic losses for the District and its citizens, including critical infrastructure customers and other\nhigh-priority users of electricity. It can be expected that similar outages on the electric company\u2019s\noverhead distribution system will continue to occur absent taking additional intensified outageprevention measures.\n(2) Electric system modernization is necessary to establish 21st century electric\ndistribution systems to promote the public interest through increased system reliability, resiliency,\nreliability, and flexibility during all types of weather events, including major storms. The frequency\nof electric power outages within the District can be expected to decrease when overhead power lines\nin vulnerable locations are relocated underground. Consequently, selectively undergrounding\ncertain overhead power lines can be expected to increase system reliability and reduce the\neconomic, social, and other impacts on the District\u2019s electricity users caused by repeated power\noutages.\n(3) Section 490 of the Home Rule Act provides that the Council may by act\nauthorize the issuance of District Bonds to borrow money to finance, refinance, or reimburse, and to\nassist in the financing, refinancing, or reimbursing of, the cost of capital projects or undertakings\n(including utility facilities) that will contribute to the health, welfare, or safety of residents of the\nDistrict, as determined by the Council.\n\nNew\n\u00a7 34-1311.02\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Law 20-102, effective May 3, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3184\n\n(4) The authorization, issuance, sale, and delivery of securitized Bonds, the\nproceeds of which shall be used by DDOT to finance the construction of certain underground\nfacilities that will be used by the electric company in connection with undergrounding\nparticularly vulnerable electric power lines and their ancillary facilities, thus, contributing to the\nhealth, welfare, and safety of residents of the District, are in the public interest and will\naccomplish the purposes and intent of section 490 of the Home Rule Act.\n(5) Electric system modernization will require an unprecedented investment by\nthe District and the electric company, which consequently, will be paid by District ratepayers\nthrough the DDOT Underground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Charge and the\nUnderground Project Charge.\n(6) A special financing structure to support this unprecedented improvement to\nthe electricity distribution infrastructure requires a specific legislative framework, and this\nlegislation establishes that framework. The additional charges authorized by this legislation will\nbe used solely to finance the construction and implementation of improvements to the\ndistribution system to increase system reliability.\n(7) The Council finds that the Mayor and the electrical company should make\nevery practical effort to ensure that District residents are hired for newly created jobs funded by\nany mechanism wherein the costs of such funding are recovered through the DDOT\nUnderground Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement Charge or the Underground Project\nCharge, with a goal being that at least 100% of all related jobs are filled by District residents and\n100% of the construction contracts are awarded to District businesses, where qualified to\nperform such work. Moreover, the Mayor and the electric company should make every practical\neffort to increase the use of District apprentices when executing contractor and subcontractor\nagreements to implement electric system modernization.\n(8) By December 31, 2015, and by each December 31st and June 30th thereafter\nuntil December 31, 2027, or the sooner completion of the work contemplated by this act, the\nMayor and the electric company shall issue written reports to the Council that describe and\nevaluate their respective efforts in meeting the stated goals of this act, where applicable, to\nidentify, hire, and train District residents, where qualified to perform such work, and award\nconstruction contract to District businesses.\n(9) The Mayor and the electric company will be expected to make every practical\neffort to achieve these goals through contracting and hiring procedures that award additional\npreference points to qualified businesses and labor resources that advance the goals of this\nlegislation.\nTITLE II.

The sole responsibility of the electric\ncompany shall be to act in an agency capacity for the collection of the DDOT Underground Electric\nCompany Infrastructure Improvement Revenue and to remit the DDOT Underground Electric\nCompany Infrastructure Improvement Revenue to a trustee in accordance with the servicing\nagreement.
