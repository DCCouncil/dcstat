(a) There exists an immediate need to implement the provisions of Bill 191013, the Safety-Based Traffic Enforcement Amendment Act of 2012, which was approved by\nthe Council on 2nd reading on December 18, 2012.\n(b) Bill 19-1013 amends the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations to reduce the\nfines for several traffic violations, including speeding, failure to clear an intersection, right turn\non red violations, and failure to stop and give right of way to a pedestrian in a roadway. Bill 191013 further requires that the Mayor transmit to the Council an assessment of any safety impact\nresulting from the fine reductions under the bill, post signs identifying the District as a strict\ntraffic enforcement zone, transmit to the Council a plan for the expansion of automated traffic\nenforcement in the District, complete a District-wide assessment of speed limits, and revise\nexisting speed limits in the District through rulemaking. Bill 19-1013 also clarifies the\nrequirements for a vehicle stopping for a pedestrian in a crosswalk.\n(c) At the December 18, 2012, legislative meeting, the Council adopted the provisions of\nBill 19-1013 on an emergency basis, the Safety-Based Traffic Enforcement Emergency\nAmendment Act of 2012, signed by the Mayor on January 19, 2103 (D.C. Act 19-635; 60 DCR\n1731), but that measure is set to expire on April 19, 2013. As the permanent version of the bill is\nnot projected to become law until May 7, 2013, a Congressional review emergency is necessary\nto prevent a gap in the law.\n\nProposed Resolution\n20-175\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C.
