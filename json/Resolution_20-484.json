Resolution 20-484, effective June 3, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3432\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency, due to congressional review, with respect to the need to amend\nthe District of Columbia Traffic Act, 1925, to allow a person who was previously assigned a\nsocial security number but who can no longer establish legal presence in the United States to be\neligible to obtain a limited purpose driver\u2019s license, permit, or identification card.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cDriver\u2019s Safety Clarification Congressional Review Emergency\nDeclaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. Section 8c of the District of Columbia Traffic Act, 1925, effective January 17, 2014\n(D.C. Law 20-62; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 50-1401.05), provides for the issuance of a limited purpose\ndriver\u2019s license, permit, or identification card to individuals who had not been assigned a social\nsecurity number or could not establish legal presence in the United States. The unintended result is\nthat an individual who was assigned a social security number at one point but can no longer\nestablish legal presence in the United States would be precluded from obtaining a limited purpose\ndriver\u2019s license, permit, or identification card. This amendment would allow for such an individual\nto be eligible to obtain a limited purpose driver\u2019s license, permit, or identification card.\nFurthermore, this congressional review emergency legislation is necessary to ensure that there is no\ngap between when the original emergency legislation expires and when the temporary version of\nthis legislation becomes effective.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Driver\u2019s\nSafety Clarification Congressional Review Emergency Amendment Act of 2014 be adopted after\na single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-822\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-350\n20 DCStat 3342\n\nDriver\u2019s\nSafety\nClarification\nCongressional\nReview\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\f",
