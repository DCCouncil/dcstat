Resolution 19-755, effective December 18, 2012\n\n20 DCSTAT 564\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed Resolution\n19-1179\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to clarify that in 2013 \u201cInaugural Week\u201d\nruns from January 15 through January 22.\n\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C. Act 19-614\n20 DCSTAT 379\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \"Inaugural Hours Emergency Declaration Resolution of\n2012\".\n\nInaugural Hours\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of 2012\n\nSec. 2. There exists an immediate need to amend \u00a7 25-723(e)(1) of the D.C. Official\nCode because the intent of the provision, which extends the legal hours for service and sale of\nalcohol during a period of time designated \u201cInaugural Week\u201d will not be effectuated in January\n2013, as currently drafted. The intent of the provision was to allow extended sales and service of\nalcohol for a period of time which would begin on January 15 in a presidential inaugural year\nand would end the early morning after the Presidential Inauguration which occurs on January 20.\nHowever in this year, the public, ceremonial Inaugural events will occur on January 21. Thus, in\norder to effectuate the intent of law, in 2013, the designation of \u201cInaugural Week\u201d must be\nextended to include January 22.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nInaugural Hours Emergency Act of 2012 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
