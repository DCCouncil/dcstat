Resolution 20-25, effective February 5, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 723\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed Resolution\n20-76\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency, due to Congressional review, with respect to the need to approve\nan extension of time to dispose of District-owned real property located at 5131 Nannie Helen\nBurroughs Avenue, N.E., known as the Strand Theater.\n\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C. Act 20-11\n20 DCSTAT 464\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cExtension of Time to Dispose of the Strand Theater\nCongressional Review Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nExtension of Time to\nDispose of the\nStrand Theater\nCongressional\nReview Emergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of 2013\n\nSec. 2. (a) On June 16, 2008, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic\nDevelopment awarded Washington Metropolitan Community Development Corporation\n(\u201cDeveloper\u201d), exclusive rights to negotiate to redevelop the District-owned real property located\nat 5131 Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue, N.E., known for tax and assessment purposes as Lot\n801 in Square 5196 (\u201cStrand Theater\u201d), along with an adjacent developer-owned property, as\npart of a commercial-use project that will include vibrant, street-front retail, a community and\noffice space, and off-street parking.\n(b) Pursuant to the Land Disposition Agreement (\u201cLDA\u201d) dated March 30, 2010, the\nDeveloper is required to secure all sources of financing for the Strand Theater as a condition\nprecedent to closing. Due to a risk-adverse market, lender underwriting standards were raised in\nterms of equity requirements and debt-service coverage ratios, forcing a slight reduction in the\nproject\u2019s scale. Lender requirements that a retail tenant be secured before committing financing\nto the project have led to further delays. Additionally, other sources of funding, including public\nlenders, would not commit until the developer secured a higher loan-to-value ratio.\n(c) The Developer has secured a letter of intent from a retail tenant and has begun to\ncomplete all pre-development activities associated with securing all sources of funding for the\nproject, as required by the LDA. Due to delays in securing financing, exacerbated by the\nrequirement that a retail tenant be secured, closing will not occur by the expiration of the\nCouncil\u2019s previous extension to October 6, 2012, pursuant to the Strand Theater Disposition\nExtension Approval Resolution of 2011, effective September 20, 2011 (Res. 19-360; 58 DCR\n8477).\n(d) On October 4, 2012, the Council enacted the Extension of Time to Dispose of the\nStrand Theater Emergency Amendment Act of 2012, effective October 4, 2012 (D.C. Act 19457; 59 DCR 11748) (\"emergency legislation\"), which remedied the above-referenced\nissues. The emergency legislation expired on January 2, 2013.\n(e) Accompanying temporary legislation has not completed a 30-day Congressional\nreview period required by section 602(c)(1) of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act,\napproved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 813; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 1-206.02(c)(1)), and is not\nprojected to become law until March of 2013.\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-25, effective February 5, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 724\n\n(f) The emergency legislation extended the Mayor\u2019s disposition authority for the\nProperty until October 6, 2013, to allow the parties to meet the closing and pre-development\ndeadlines. It is important that the provisions of the emergency legislation remain in effect with\nminimal interruption until the temporary legislation takes effect.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nExtension of Time to Dispose of the Strand Theater Congressional Review Emergency\nAmendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
