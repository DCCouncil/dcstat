  "text": "COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-620, effective September 23, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 4521\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the District of Columbia\nMunicipal Regulations to allow a student with disabilities attending a private school to play on a\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools (\u201cDCPS\u201d) sports team if the student has played with the\nteam for at least 2 years and resides within the DCPS school\u2019s boundary.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cDCPS Football for Special Needs Students Regulation\nEmergency Declaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. Findings.\n(a) The purpose of this emergency legislation is to hold harmless 2 students with\nlearning disabilities who are being unfairly penalized for a mistake made by the District of\nColumbia Public Schools (\u201cDCPS\u201d). For the past 2 seasons, DCPS has allowed 2 students with\nlearning disabilities who attend a special education school that does not offer football to play on\nthe football team of Woodrow Wilson High School (\u201cWilson\u201d), the students\u2019 in-boundary DCPS\nhigh school. The District\u2019s State Athletic Rules expressly permit DCPS to let students with\nlearning disabilities to play for Wilson. 5 DCMR \u00a7 2701.12(c). The rules even allow DCPS to\ncharge the parents for the cost of playing on the team, so that allowing the students to pay does\nnot cost the District anything. Id. Unfortunately, this year, DCPS kicked the students off of the\nteam the day of their first game.\n(b) DCPS\u2019s position is that whether the students can play for Wilson depends solely\nupon who is paying the tuition for them to attend the special education school. If DCPS is\npaying their tuition, DCPS would allow the students to play for Wilson. Here, however,\nbecause the parents are paying the students\u2019 tuition (thus, saving the District tens of thousands\nof dollars per year), the students cannot play for Wilson. Unfortunately, DCPS did not follow\nits own policy and allowed these students to play for Wilson for the past 2 seasons.\n(c) This emergency legislation would not change DCPS\u2019 policy. DCPS could maintain\nthis questionable practice if it so chooses. This bill simply grandfathers in the 2 students who\nhave been playing for Wilson for the past 2 seasons and allows them to remain on the team until\nthey graduate. DCPS is at fault for not following its own policy and allowing these students\nwith disabilities to play for Wilson for the past 2 years, and these students should not be\npunished for DCPS\u2019 mistake.\n(d) Organized sports can have profound benefits for students with disabilities. Playing\nsports can boost their confidence and self-esteem and can help advance their development. It\nimproves their coordination and range of motion. Additionally, by being part of a sports team, a\nquintessential experience of youth, these children can have a sense of normalcy. Moreover,\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-1044\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-427\n20 DCStat 4142\n\nDCPS\nFootball for\nSpecial Needs\nStudents\nRegulation\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-620, effective September 23, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 4522\n\nincreased integration with the broader community and children with different backgrounds\nbenefits the development and wellness of children with disabilities.\n(e) This emergency legislation is narrowly tailored and precisely limited to simply hold\nharmless the 2 students with special needs who have been playing for Wilson for the past 2\nyears and who through no fault of their own have been kicked off the team that they love. They\nlive within the Wilson boundary and but for their need for special education would attend\nWilson.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the DCPS\nFootball for Special Needs Students Regulation Emergency Amendment Act of 2014 be adopted\nafter a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
