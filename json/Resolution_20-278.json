Resolution 20-278, effective September 17, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2667\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to require the Office of the Chief\nFinancial Officer to review all residential real property tax liens sold between September 1,\n2003, and September 1, 2013, to consider whether any real property foreclosed upon after a tax\nlien of less than $2,500 was sold as the result of excusable neglect or other equitable\ncircumstances warranting relief, to identify what type of relief would provide substantial justice\nto individuals whose properties were improperly sold, and to submit a report on these matters to\nthe Council by January 31, 2014.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cTax Lien Compensation and Relief Reporting Emergency\nDeclaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) Last week, the Washington Post (the \u201cPost\u201d) published the results of an indepth investigation into the District\u2019s real property tax sale process. The Post documented\nnumerous instances where seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable\nresidents lost their homes and forfeited tens of thousands of dollars in equity after predatory\ncompanies purchased liens from relatively small amounts of unpaid taxes.\n(b) In addition to freezing the sale of tax liens and improving the procedures and\nmanagement of this process, there is an urgent need to understand the breadth of the problem\ndisclosed by the Post and the extent and equity of the harms created.\n(c) This emergency legislation would direct the Office of the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s\n(\u201cOCFO\u201d) Office of Integrity and Oversight to broadly review all residential real property tax\nliens sold between September 1, 2003 and September 1, 2013, and to conduct a detailed review\nof the circumstances of the sales of real property tax liens under $2,500 that occurred within this\ntime period. It would require the OCFO to submit a report to the Council by January 31, 2014\non these claims and what remedies would be appropriate.\n(d) This emergency legislation is necessary for the Council and the District to have a\ncomplete understanding of the problems that occurred and how the District can provide\nsubstantial justice to the residents that were unfairly harmed by this process.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nTax Lien Compensation and Relief Reporting Emergency Act of 2013 be adopted after a single\nreading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-421\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
