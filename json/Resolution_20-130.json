Findings.\n(a) The District is the owner of the real property located at 5901 9th Street, N.W.,\ncommonly known as the Paul School and designated for tax and assessment purposes as Lot\n0814, Square 2985 (\u201cProperty\u201d). The Property is comprised of a building containing\napproximately 128,400 square feet.\n(b) The Property is currently occupied by the Paul Public Charter School (\u201cPaul School\u201d),\nand has been since 2003, pursuant to a lease that expires on August 31, 2018. The Paul School\napproached the District through the Department of General Services about entering into a new\nlong-term lease in exchange for completely renovating and remodeling the Property without any\nDistrict funds and expanding its operation to include a high school program benefiting many of\nthe residents of Ward 4.\n(c) The Paul School is the only charter school conversion in the District, which began as\na public school. The Property has served as a public school, either traditional or charter, since\napproximately 1930. Given the current use of the Property as a high-performing charter school, it\nis not in the best interest of the District to change the use of the Property.\n(d) The most viable option for the Property is to maintain its continued use as a public\neducation facility. Declaring that the Property is no longer required for public purposes and\ndisposing of it under a long-term ground lease, or other method, is the most expedient and costeffective solution to:\n(1) Reactivate the Property;\n(2) Provide public benefits, such as a charter school;\n(3) Allow the District to retain long-term fee-simple ownership of the Property;\nand\n(4) Provide residents with outstanding educational services.\n(e) Pursuant to section 1(a-1)(4) of an Act Authorizing the sale of certain real estate in the\nDistrict of Columbia no longer required for public purposes, approved August 5, 1939 (53 Stat.\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.
