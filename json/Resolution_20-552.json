As\nthe Initial Contract did not authorize any specific work or constitute a guarantee that any work\nwould be assigned to Blue Skye Construction, LLC, no Council approval was required. Task\nOrder No. 001 was then issued for $811,554, and since the aggregate value of the Initial\nContract and Task Order No. 001 was less than $1 million, no Council approval was required.\n(c) Subsequently, the Initial Contract\u2019s terms and conditions were amended and restated,\nresulting in the issuance of the Amended and Restated Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal\nYear 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects (\u201cContract\u201d) with an established not-toexceed value of $10 million. All future work, if any, under the Contract will be awarded and\nreleased through individual project task orders, based on a competitive bidding process, as set\nforth in Section 1.2 of the Contract. Task orders may be issued up to the maximum not-toexceed amount of $10 million, which will cause the aggregate value of the Contract and task\norder to exceed the $1 million threshold under section 451 of the District of Columbia Home\nRule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 803; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 1-204.51).\n(d) Approval of the Amended and Restated Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal Year\n2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects Contract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001A,\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-899\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
