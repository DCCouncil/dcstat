Resolution 20-435, effective March 4, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3136\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the Recreation Act of 1994 to\nclarify that implementation of the Department of Parks and Recreation\u2019s nutritional requirements\nis not contingent upon promulgation of unrelated regulations concerning field and facility\npermitting.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cDepartment of Parks and Recreation Fee-based Use Permit\nAuthority Clarification Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) In December 2012, the Council enacted D.C. Law 19-280, the Department of\nParks and Recreation Fee-based Use Permit Authority Amendment Act of 2012. This law\nauthorized the Department of Parks and Recreation (\u201cDPR\u201d) to issue fee-based use permits,\nmade other changes to DPR\u2019s permitting process, and established nutritional standards for DPR\nfacilities.\n(b) Technical amendments made to this law inadvertently made the implementation of\nthe nutritional standards contingent upon DPR\u2019s adoption of an unrelated set of new regulations\nconcerning permitting that DPR has not yet issued. During the fiscal year 2015 oversight\nprocess, DPR cited this language in explaining why it has not implemented its nutritional\nstandards.\n(c) This emergency legislation clarifies that the nutritional standards for DPR are not\ncontingent upon an unrelated set of rules concerning permitting.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nDepartment of Parks and Recreation Fee-based Use Permit Authority Clarification Emergency\nAmendment Act of 2014 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-677\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-299\n20 DCStat 3068\n\nDepartment of\nParks and\nRecreation\nFee-based Use\nPermit\nAuthority\nClarification\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\f",
