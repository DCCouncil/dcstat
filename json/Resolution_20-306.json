Resolution 20-306, effective October 1, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2717\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to create a separate fund for fees for\nproject review and mitigation measures by developers, property owners, and utility companies in\nconnection with projects on private property or public space that may impact the District\nDepartment of Transportation\u2019s ability to manage and maintain the transportation infrastructure\nin the District.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cTransportation Infrastructure Mitigation Emergency Declaration\nResolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. The District Department of Transportation (\u201cDDOT\u201d) needs authority to receive\nfunds from developers, property owners, and utility companies in connection with projects on\nprivate property or public space that may impact the safe flow of buses, trucks, passenger\nvehicles, and other modes of transportation through the District. Pursuant to Board of Zoning\norders or similar directives from outside agencies, developers and property owners are required\nfrom time to time, to provide DDOT with funds to study and mitigate the impact of their\nprojects on the transportation infrastructure. Until recently, those funds were transferred to the\nDistrict using the donation system. However, recent legal review has determined that DDOT\nmust receive those funds through an appropriation approved by Congress. This legislation will\nenable DDOT to continue receiving these funds and installing the necessary traffic mitigation\nmeasures, which in turn will ensure the public safety at or near new or improved developments.\nWithout this legislation, DDOT will not have enough funds to study the impact of new or\nimproved developments and install the necessary traffic signals or other devices to ensure\npedestrian and vehicular safety at those locations.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nTransportation Infrastructure Mitigation Emergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a\nsingle reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-415\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-198\n20 DCStat 2444\n\nTransportation\nInfrastructure\nMitigation\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\f",
