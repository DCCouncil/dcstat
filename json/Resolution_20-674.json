(a) On January 18, 2013, Chairman Phil Mendelson, at the request of the Mayor,\nintroduced Bill 20-71, the Boards and Commissions Reform Act of 2013. That legislation was\nreferred to the Committee of the Whole, which held a hearing on the bill on June 5, 2014, and\napproved the bill with amendments on October 7, 2014. That bill has undergone 1st and 2nd\nreadings on October 7, 2014, and October 28, 2014.\n(b) Streamlining the District\u2019s approach to statehood by combining the functions of\nseveral defunct and unfunded boards and commissions, creating a body through which funds\ndedicated to the achievement of statehood may be accessed, and assuring the participation of the\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-1121\nSee Emergency\nD.C.

These reforms should be implemented without delay.\n(c) Reform of the District\u2019s boards and commissions should occur without delay, and\nemergency adoption of Bill 20-71 will enable this to happen. The bill reduces the number of\nboards and commissions, eliminating ineffective ones. It also strengthens several others. It is\nappropriate that this happen with the impending change in government.\n(d) In 1998, 2006, and 2010, the Council adopted emergency measures, D.C. Act 12541, D.C. Act 16-534, and D.C. Act 18-590, to assist the incoming Mayor-elect with the\ntransition into office. Again, there is that need with the new Mayor. There will also be, for the\nfirst time in the District\u2019s history, an elected Attorney General. Authorization for the Mayor to\nprovide funds and resources to the Mayor-elect and Attorney General-elect will facilitate the\norderly transition of duties and responsibilities for both offices.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the New\nColumbia Statehood Initiative, Omnibus Boards and Commissions Reform, and Election\nTransition Emergency Amendment Act of 2014 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
