No actuarial adjustment to the\nbenefit shall be made for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a\nqualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical\nbenefits), or in the case of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal\nRevenue Code, the inclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the\nextent permitted to reflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined\nbenefit dollar limit under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\"(ii) If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form not subject to\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 1256\nD.C.

To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before the date the benefits first commence,\nsuch an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring\nupon the teacher's death if the benefit provided under this act does not charge the teacher for\nproviding a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined for purposes of section 415 of\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 1258\nD.C.
