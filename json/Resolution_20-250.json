Resolution 20-250, effective July 10, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2107\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-394\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the School Transit Subsidy Act\nof 1978 to clarify the fare charged, if any, to a student traveling to and from school.\n\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-145\n20 DCStat 1996\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cSchool Transit Subsidy Emergency Declaration Resolution of\n2013\u201d.\n\nSchool Transit\nSubsidy\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\nSec. 2. (a) As part of the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Support Act of 2013 (\u201cBSA\u201d), the\nCouncil voted to make Metrobus travel free to students traveling to and from school; however,\nstudents will still be required to pay to ride on the Metrorail system on school days.\n(b) Unfortunately, the language included in the BSA would actually raise the cost of\nMetrorail travel by students by 40%.\n(c) This emergency legislation, which was drafted by the District Department of\nTransportation, would correct this error and maintain the current policy of selling monthly\nMetrorail passes to students for $30.\n(d) This emergency legislation is necessary to ensure that the cost of traveling to and\nfrom school by Metrorail for students is not increased by 40% when the new school year begins\nin August 2013.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the\ncircumstances enumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary\nthat the\nSchool Transit Subsidy Emergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
