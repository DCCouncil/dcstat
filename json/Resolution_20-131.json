Resolution 20-131, effective May 7, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 1546\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-242\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to approve the disposition of Districtowned real property located at 5901 9th Street, N.W., commonly known as the Paul School and\ndesignated for tax and assessment purposes as Lot 0814, Square 2985.\n\nSee\nEmergency\nD.C. Res.\n20-132\n20 DCStat 1547\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cPaul School Property Disposition Approval Emergency\nDeclaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nPaul School\nProperty\nDisposition\nApproval\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\nSec. 2. (a) The property is a school building located at 5901 9th Street, N.W., commonly\nknown as the Paul School and designated for tax and assessment purposes as Lot 0814, Square\n2985 (\u201c Property\u201d).\n(b) The District has not used the Property as a non-charter public school for several years.\n(c) The Department of General Services has determined that the Property is surplus to the\nDistrict\u2019s needs.\n(d) The Paul Public Charter School (\u201cPaul School\u201d) has occupied the Property since 2003\npursuant to a lease that expires on August 31, 2018. The Paul School approached the District\nthrough the Department of General Services about entering into a new long-term lease in\nexchange for completely renovating and remodeling the Property without any District funds and\nexpanding it into a high school program benefiting many of the residents of Ward 4. Given the\ncurrent use as a high-performing charter school, it is not in the best interest of the District to\nchange the use of the Property.\n(e) There is a vital need for the Council to expeditiously approve this disposition to\nfacilitate the execution of a new lease of the Property to the Paul School and to facilitate the Paul\nSchool\u2019s ability to secure financing and commence the proposed improvements to the Property.\nAny delay could jeopardize the Paul School\u2019s ability to complete construction on schedule.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Paul\nSchool Property Disposition Approval Emergency Resolution of 2013 be adopted on an\nemergency basis.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
