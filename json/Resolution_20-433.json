Resolution 20-433, effective March 4, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3133\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend section 47-4625 of the\nDistrict of Columbia Official Code to adjust the amount of retail space required for the real\nproperty known as Kelsey Gardens to qualify for a real property tax abatement.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cKelsey Gardens Redevelopment Emergency Declaration\nResolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) In 2009, the Council enacted the Kelsey Gardens Redevelopment Project Real\nProperty Limited Tax Abatement Assistance Act of 2009, effective December 17, 2009 (D.C. Law\n18-97; D.C. Official Code 47-4625) (\u201c2009 act\u201d), to provide a limited real property tax abatement to\nthe Kelsey Gardens redevelopment project (\u201cProject\u201d).\n(b) The 2009 act currently requires that the Project contain approximately 15,000 square feet\nof ground-level retail space as a condition for abatement.\n(c) The Project is on schedule and is approximately 60% complete with tenancies expected\nto commence in the summer of 2014.\n(d) On January 30, 2014, the Office of Tax and Revenue ruled that 13,363 square feet of\nretail space, the result of a minor reduction in retail space, did not meet the requirement of\napproximately 15,000 square feet.\n(e) The minor reduction in retail square footage occurred through a minor modification of\nthe planned unit development by the Zoning Commission on January 30, 2012, through its consent\ncalendar and with the support and approval of the Office of Planning and Advisory Neighborhood\nCommission 2C. The minor modification is the result of changing the location of the Project fitness\ncenter to the front of the apartment building.\n(f) The tax abatement provided by the 2009 act is necessary to complete the Project because\nthe construction financing and capital commitments for the Project were secured with the\nrepresentation that the tax abatement would be in place.\n(g) Without emergency legislation amending the retail space requirement, the Project will\nnot be completed on schedule, which will create a hardship for prospective residents and impose a\nsignificant unanticipated financial burden on the Project.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Kelsey\nGardens Redevelopment Emergency Act of 2014 be adopted after a single reading.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-675\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-302\n20 DCStat 3070\n\nKelsey Gardens\nRedevelopment\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-433, effective March 4, 2014\n\nSec. 4. The resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n20 DCSTAT 3134\n\n\f",
