Resolution 20-691, effective November 18, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 4621\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to create a Pepco Cost-Sharing Fund so\nthat the District Department of Transportation can receive funds from Potomac Electric Power\nCompany as reimbursement for cost-sharing obligations for costs associated with the District of\nColumbia Power Line Undergrounding, also known as DC PLUG, initiative, as authorized by\nElectric Company Infrastructure Improvement Financing Act of 2014.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cPepco Cost-Sharing Fund for DC PLUG Establishment\nEmergency Declaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. In anticipation of Potomac Electric Power Company (\u201cPepco\u201d) providing funds\nto the District Department of Transportation (\u201cDDOT\u201d) as reimbursement for cost-sharing\nobligations for the District of Columbia Power Line Undergrounding (\u201cDC PLUG\u201d) initiative,\nDDOT needs to have a mechanism in place to receive these funds and to spend these funds\nsolely for any permitted purpose authorized by the Electric Company Infrastructure Improvement\nFinancing Act of 2014. It is anticipated that Pepco and DDOT will cover the cost of DC PLUG\nequitably. DDOT will perform civil engineering, design and construction work, while Pepco\nwill perform the electrical engineering, design and construction and some of the civil\nengineering and design work, as needed. However, because of the nature of the work involved,\nthe costs associated with DDOT\u2019s portion of DC PLUG will outweigh Pepco\u2019s portion. In order\nto achieve an equitable cost-sharing arrangement between Pepco and DDOT, Pepco will\nreimburse DDOT for certain costs. Without the funds, which would be deposited in the Pepco\nCost-Sharing Fund for DC PLUG created by this legislation, DC PLUG would be negatively\nimpacted as the cost-sharing between Pepco and DDOT would not be balanced, and DDOT\nwould not have the funds available to fully finance its portion of DC PLUG.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Pepco\nCost-Sharing Fund for DC PLUG Establishment Emergency Act of 2014 be adopted after a\nsingle reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-1132\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-509\n20 DCStat 4432\n\nPepco CostSharing Fund\nfor DC PLUG\nEstablishment\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\f",
