In addition to the foregoing, to the extent necessary to prevent\ndisqualification under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, and subject to this subsection),\nthe maximum annual additions for any limitation year shall be equal to the lesser of:\n\"(A) The dollar limit on annual additions; or\n\"(B) 100% of the teacher's remuneration. The defined benefit dollar limit\nand the dollar limit on annual additions shall be adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under\nsection 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury\nshall prescribe. The dollar limit as adjusted under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code\nshall apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment\napplies, but a teacher's benefits shall not reflect the adjusted limit prior to January 1 of that\ncalendar year. To the extent that the monthly benefit payable to a teacher who has reached his or\nher termination date is limited by the application of this subsection, the limit shall be adjusted to\nreflect subsequent adjustments made in accordance with section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue\nCode, but the adjusted limit shall apply only to benefits payable on or after January 1 of the\ncalendar year for which the adjustment applies.\n\"(2) Benefits shall be actuarially adjusted based upon the defined benefit dollar\nlimit, as follows:\n\"(A) There shall be an adjustment for benefits payable in a form other than\na straight life annuity as follows:\n\"(i) If a monthly benefit is payable in a form other than a straight\nlife annuity, before applying the defined benefit dollar limit, the benefit shall be adjusted, in the\n\nNote,\n\u00a7 38-2021.25\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 282\nD.C.

No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be\nmade for benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability\nbenefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and postretirement medical benefits), or in the\ncase of a form of benefit not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, the\ninclusion of a feature under which a benefit increases automatically to the extent permitted to\nreflect cost-of-living adjustments and the increase, if any, in the defined benefit dollar limit\nunder section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\"(ii) If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form not subject to\nsection 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity\n(without regard to cost-of-living adjustments described in this subsection) is equal to the greater\nof the annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the teacher commencing at\nthe same time, or the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same time\nthat has the same actuarial present value as the teacher's form of benefit, computed using a 5%\ninterest rate and the applicable mortality designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time\nto time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\"(iii) If the benefit of a teacher is paid in a form subject to section\n417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is equal to\nthe greatest of:\n\"(I) The annual amount of the straight life annuity having a\ncommencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher's form of benefit,\ncomputed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in the\ndefinition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;\n\"(II) The annual amount of the straight life annuity\ncommencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher's form of benefit,\ncomputed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table designated by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal\nRevenue Code; or\n\"(III) The annual amount of the straight life annuity\ncommencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the teacher's form of\nbenefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated\nby the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal\nRevenue Code, divided by 1.05.\n\"(iv) For the purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph,\nwhether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is determined\nwithout regard to the status of this act and the associated act as a government plan as described in\nsection 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\"(B) There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before age 62\nor after age 65 as follows:\n\"(i) If the benefit of a teacher begins before age 62, the defined\nbenefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 283\nD.C.

However, if the benefit provided under this act provides an\nimmediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age of benefit\ncommencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\"(I) The limitation determined under the immediately\npreceding sentence; or\n\"(II) The defined benefit dollar limit, adjusted for\nparticipation of fewer than 10 years if applicable, multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of\nthe immediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at the age of benefit\ncommencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under\nthis act at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The\nadjustment in sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits\npaid on account of disability under section 4 or as a result of the death of a teacher under section\n9.\n\"(ii) If the benefit of a teacher begins after age 65, the defined\nbenefit dollar limit applicable to the teacher at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the\nform of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is actuarially equivalent to the\ndefined benefit dollar limit applicable at age 65 (adjusted for participation of fewer than 10\nyears, if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality\ntable designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3)\nof the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this act provides an\nimmediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit\ncommencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\"(I) The limitation determined under the immediately\npreceding sentence; or\n\"(II) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for\nparticipation of less than 10 years if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of\nthe adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at the age of benefit\ncommencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life\nannuity under this act at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this section.\nFor this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at the\nage the benefit commences is the annual amount of the annuity payable to the teacher, computed\ndisregarding the teacher's accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial adjustments, even if\nthose actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted immediately\ncommencing straight life annuity under this act at age 65 is the annual amount of such annuity\nthat would be payable under this act to a hypothetical teacher who is age 65 and has the same\nannuity as the teacher.\n\"(iii) For the purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section, no\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 284\nD.C. Act 19-584, effective January 1, 2013 (Expiration date April 1, 2013)\n\nadjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the probability of a\nteacher's death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65 and the\ncommencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the teacher prior\nto the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent benefits are forfeited upon death before\nthe date the benefits first commence, such an adjustment shall be made. For this purpose, no\nforfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the teacher's death if the benefit provided under this\nact does not charge the teacher for providing a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as\ndefined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code) upon the teacher's death.\n\"(3) If the teacher has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined benefit\nportion of this act (as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and associated\nregulations), the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this act and the denominator\nof which is 10. The adjustment in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall not apply to benefits paid\non account of disability under section 4(d) or as a result of the death of a teacher under section 9.\nIn the case of years of credited service credited to a teacher pursuant to section 8:\n\"(A) The limitation contained in subsections (c)(1)(A) and (b)(3) of this\nsection shall not apply to the portion of the teacher's accrued retirement benefit (determined as of\nthe annuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service\nunder section 8 that are actuarially funded by:\n\"(i) A transfer or rollover from the teacher's account under a\nretirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an eligible\ndeferred compensation plan within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code\nor from an individual retirement account; or\n\"(ii) A direct payment.\n\"(B) The limitation contained in subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(3) of this\nsection shall apply to the portion of the teacher's accrued retirement benefit (determined as of the\nannuity commencement date) that is attributable to any additional years of credited service under\nsection 8 that are not actuarially funded by:\n\"(i) A transfer or rollover from the teacher's account under a\nretirement plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or an eligible\ndeferred compensation plan (within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code)\nor from an individual retirement account; or\n\"(ii) A direct payment.\n\"(C) The determination of the extent to which additional years of credited\nservice under section 8 have been actuarially funded as of the annuity commencement date shall\nbe determined in accordance with section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (using the\nactuarial assumptions thereunder), applied as if section 411(c) of the Internal Revenue Code\napplied and treating the amount transferred from a plan qualified under section 401(a) of the\nInternal Revenue Code, the teacher's account under an eligible deferred compensation plan\n(within the meaning of section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), or an individual retirement\naccount, or the amount of the direct lump-sum payment to the Custodian of Retirement Funds, as\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 285\nD.C.
