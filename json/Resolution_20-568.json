In 2007, the District passed Title II of the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget Support Act of 2006\n(\u201cBSA\u201d) to provide funding for affordable housing for extremely low income households in the District.\nThe passage of the BSA created the Local Rent Supplement Program (\u201cLRSP\u201d), a program designed to\nprovide affordable housing and supportive services to extremely low income District residents, including\nthose who are homeless or in need of supportive services, such as elderly individuals or those with\ndisabilities, through project-based, tenant-based and sponsored-based LRSP affordable housing units.\nThe BSA provided for the District of Columbia Housing Authority (\u201cDCHA\u201d) to administer the LRSP\non behalf of the District.\nSec. 3. In April 2013, DCHA participated in a Request for Proposals issued by the District of\nColumbia Department of Housing and Community Development (\u201cDHCD\u201d). Of the total proposals\nreceived, 18 developers were chosen to work with DCHA and other District agencies to develop\naffordable housing and permanent supportive housing units for extremely low income families making 0\nto 30% of the area\u2019s median income, as well as the chronically homeless and individuals with mental or\nphysical disabilities throughout the District. Upon approval of the contract by the Council, DCHA will\nenter into an agreement to enter into a long-term contract (\u201cALTSC\u201d) with the selected housing\nproviders under the LRSP for housing services provided under the contract.\nSec. 4. (a) There exists an immediate need to approve a certain ALTSC with Transitional\nHousing Corporation under the District of Columbia Housing Authority\u2019s Local Rent Supplement\nProgram to provide long term affordable housing units for extremely low-income households in the\nDistrict of Columbia for units at Partner Arms 1, located at 935 Kennedy Street N.W.\n(b) The emergency legislation to approve the contract will authorize an ALTSC between the\nDistrict of Columbia Housing Authority and Transitional Housing Corporation with respect to the\npayment of rental subsidy and allow the owner to lease the rehabilitated units at Partner Arms 1 and\nhouse District of Columbia extremely low income households with incomes at 30% or less of the area\nmedian income.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-965\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
