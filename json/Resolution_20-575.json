Resolution 20-575, effective July 14, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3991\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-969\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to approve the commemorative work in\nChuck Brown Park to be known as the Chuck Brown Memorial.\n\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-414\n20 DCStat 3913\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cChuck Brown Memorial Commemorative Work Emergency\nDeclaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nChuck Brown\nMemorial\nCommemorative\nWork\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\nSec. 2. (a) On May 28, 2014, Chairman Phil Mendelson, at the request of the Mayor,\nintroduced PR 20-808, the Chuck Brown Memorial, Carter G. Woodson Memorial, and Metro\nMemorial Park Commemorative Works Approval Resolution of 2014. That legislation was\nreferred to the Committee of the Whole, which held a hearing on the resolution on July 2, 2014.\n(b) The proposed Chuck Brown Memorial contained in PR 20-808 has received\nnecessary approvals from all relevant local and federal boards and commissions, including the\nCommission on the Arts and Humanities, the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee,\nthe National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts, the local Advisory\nNeighborhood Commission, and the Commemorative Works Committee.\n(c) The Chuck Brown Memorial is designed to celebrate the life of District resident\nCharles Louis \u201cChuck\u201d Brown (1936-2012), an American guitarist and singer known as the\nGodfather of Go-Go, who in 1942, at the age of 15, moved to Washington, D.C., where he\ndeveloped his musical style to compete with disco.\n(d) The memorial will honor a local legend and educate visitors on Brown's\ncontributions to Go-Go, a subgenre of funk music, which he pioneered in and around\nWashington, D.C., in the mid and late 1970s. The memorial will include a mural incorporated\ninto a plaza that will list Chuck Brown's discography along with several sculptures of\ninstruments representing those used to perform Go-Go.\n(e) Because all necessary approvals have been obtained, funding has been identified,\nand planning for the Memorial is well underway, and because the opening of the memorial\ncould coincide with what would have been Chuck Brown\u2019s birthday on August 22, 2014, the\nmemorial should be approved prior to the Council\u2019s recess beginning on July 15, 2014.\n(f) PR 20-808 contained approvals for 2 other memorials which have not yet received\nall necessary approvals from local and federal entities. PR 20-808, however, cannot be adopted\nonly in part to approve the Chuck Brown Memorial. Because of procedural time constraints, the\nCouncil could not act to consider another resolution submitted before the recess.\n(g) Approval of emergency legislation will allow the development of the Chuck Brown\nMemorial to proceed over the summer.\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-575, effective July 14, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3992\n\nSec. 3 The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Chuck\nBrown Memorial Commemorative Works Emergency Approval Act of 2014 be adopted after a\nsingle reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately\n\n\f",
