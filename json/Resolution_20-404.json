(a) There exists an immediate need to clarify recent amendments to section 2 of\nAn Act To create a Department of Corrections in the District of Columbia, approved June 27,\n1946 (60 Stat. 320; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 24-211.02).\n(b) The recent amendments transferred the management and operation of the Central\nCellblock at 300 Indiana Avenue, N.W., from the Metropolitan Police Department to the\nDepartment of Corrections.\n(c) The transfer took effect on October 1, 2013.\n(d) The language establishing the transfer did not include express authority for the\nDepartment of Correction to be responsible for persons detained by MPD at medical facilities in\nthe District prior to an initial court appearance. The proposed clarification would clearly\nestablish that authority.\n(e) Emergency legislation, the Department of Corrections Central Cellblock\nManagement Clarification Emergency Amendment Act of 2013, effective December 6, 2013\n(D.C. Act 20-215; 60 DCR 16520), expires on February 18, 2014.\n(f) Temporary legislation, the Department of Corrections Central Cellblock Management\nClarification Temporary Amendment Act of 2013, signed by the Mayor on December 21, 2013\n(D.C.

Act 20-276\n20 DCStat 3036\n\nDepartment of\nCorrections\nCentral\nCellblock\nManagement\nClarification\nCongressional\nReview\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.
