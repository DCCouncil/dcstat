(a) There exists an immediate need to clarify recent amendments to section 2 of\nAn Act To create a Department of Corrections in the District of Columbia, approved June 27,\n1946 (60 Stat. 320; D.C.

The proposed clarification would clearly\nestablish that authority.\n(e) Emergency legislation, the Department of Corrections Central Cellblock\nManagement Clarification Emergency Amendment Act of 2013, effective December 6, 2013\n(D.C. Act 20-215; 60 DCR 16520), expires on February 18, 2014.\n(f) Temporary legislation, the Department of Corrections Central Cellblock Management\nClarification Temporary Amendment Act of 2013, signed by the Mayor on December 21, 2013\n(D.C.
