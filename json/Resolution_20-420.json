Resolution 20-420, effective February 4, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3118\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to approve a contract with the National\nRailroad Passenger Corporation to lease certain property from the National Railroad Passenger\nCorporation necessary for the Kenilworth section of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cKenilworth Section of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail Contract\nApproval Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) Pursuant to section 451 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved\nDecember 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 803; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 1-204.51, the Mayor transmitted to the\nCouncil a request for Council approval of a contract under which the District would lease certain\nproperty owned by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\u201cAmtrak\u201d) critical for the\nKenilworth section of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail, across Parcel 180/5 for an initial term of 50\nyears, with options for renewal terms, and provide for a contingency fund of $2 million for 7 years.\n(b) The Anacostia Riverwalk Trail is funded in large part through a TIGER Grant from the\nUnited States Department of Transportation under the provisions of the Consolidated and Further\nContinuing Appropriations Act, 2012, approved November 18, 2011 (Pub. L. No. 112-55; 125 Stat.\n552; ). The TIGER Grant Agreement provided that the right of way across the Amtrak parcel be\nacquired by October 2012. Because the negotiations with Amtrak took longer than anticipated, the\nTIGER Grant funds will be in jeopardy unless the Council immediately approves the Kenilworth\nsection of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail Contract, so that construction may commence in\naccordance with the TIGER Grant Agreement.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nKenilworth section of the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail Contract Emergency Approval Resolution\nof 2014 be adopted on an emergency basis.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-626\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Res. 20-421\n20 DCStat 3119\n\nKenilworth\nSection of the\nAnacostia\nRiverwalk\nTrail Contract\nApproval\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\f",
