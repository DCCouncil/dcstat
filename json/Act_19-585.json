Act 19-585, effective January 1, 2013 (Expiration date April 1, 2013)\n\nhaving a commencement date that has the same actuarial present value as the member\u2019s form of\nbenefit, computed using the interest rate and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in\nthe definition of actuarial equivalent for adjusting benefits in the same form;\n\"(bb) The annual amount of the straight life annuity\ncommencing at the time that has the same actuarial present value as the member\u2019s form of\nbenefit, computed using a 5.5% interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table\ndesignated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code; or\n\"(cc) The annual amount of the straight life annuity\ncommencing at the same time that has the same actuarial present value as the member\u2019s form of\nbenefit, computed using the applicable interest rate and the applicable mortality table designated\nby the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant to section 417(e)(3) of the Internal\nRevenue Code, divided by 1.05.\n\"(IV) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(B)(i) of this\nsubsection, whether a form of benefit is subject to section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code is\ndetermined without regard to the status of this act as a governmental plan as described in section\n414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\"(ii) There shall be an adjustment to benefits that commence before\nage 62 or after age 65 as follows:\n\"(I) If the benefit of a member begins before age 62, the\ndefined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at the earlier age shall be an annual benefit\npayable in the form a straight life annuity beginning at the earlier age that is the actuarial\nequivalent of the defined benefit dollar limit applicable to the member at age 62 (adjusted for\nparticipation of fewer than 10 years if applicable) computed using a 5% interest rate and the\napplicable mortality table designated by the Secretary of the Treasury from time to time pursuant\nto section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the benefit provided under this\nact provides an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 62 and the age\nof benefit commencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\"(aa) The limitation determined under the\nimmediately preceding sentence; or\n\"(bb) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for\nparticipation of fewer than 10 years if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of\nthe immediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at the age of benefit\ncommencement to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under\nthis act at age 62, both determined without applying the limitations of this section. The\nadjustment in sub-subparagraph (i) of this subparagraph shall not apply as a result of benefits\npaid on account of disability under sections 12(f) or 12(g) or as a result of the death of a member\nunder section 12(k). Notwithstanding the provisions above, a member that qualifies under\nsection 415(b)(2(G) of the Internal Revenue Code is not subject to the adjustment to benefits that\ncommence before age 62.\n\"(II) If the benefit of a member begins after age 65, the\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n20 DCSTAT 295\nD.C.

However, if the benefit provided under this act provides an\nimmediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age 65 and the age of benefit\ncommencement, the defined benefit dollar limit is the lesser of:\n\"(aa) The limitation determined under the\nimmediately preceding sentence; or\n\"(bb) The defined benefit dollar limit (adjusted for\nparticipation of less than 10 years if applicable) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of\nthe adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at the age of benefit\ncommencement to the annual amount of the adjusted immediately commencing straight life\nannuity under this act at age 65, both determined without applying the limitations of this\nsection. For this purpose, the adjusted immediately commencing straight life annuity under this\nact at the age the benefit commences is the annual amount of such annuity payable to the\nmember, computed disregarding the member\u2019s accruals after age 65 but including any actuarial\nadjustments, even if those actuarial adjustments are used to offset accruals; and the adjusted\nimmediately commencing straight life annuity under this act at age 65 is the annual amount of\nsuch annuity that would be payable under this act to a hypothetical member who is age 65 and\nhas the same annuity as the member.\n\"(III) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(B) of this\nsubsection, no adjustment shall be made to the defined benefit dollar limit to reflect the\nprobability of a member\u2019s death between the commencing date and age 62, or between age 65\nand the commencing date, as applicable, if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the\nmember prior to the annuity having a commencing date. To the extent that benefits are forfeited\nupon death before the date the benefits first commence, an adjustment shall be made. For this\npurpose, no forfeiture shall be treated as occurring upon the member\u2019s death if the benefit\nprovided under this act does not charge the member for providing a qualified preretirement\nsurvivor annuity (as defined for purposes of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code) upon the\nmember\u2019s death.\n\"(C) If the member has fewer than 10 years of participation in the defined\nbenefit portion of this act (as determined under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code and\nthe regulations thereunder), the defined benefit dollar limit shall be multiplied by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation under this act and\nthe denominator of which is 10. The adjustment in this subsection shall not apply to benefits\npaid on account of disability under sections 12(f) or (g) or as a result of the death of a member\nunder section 12(k).
