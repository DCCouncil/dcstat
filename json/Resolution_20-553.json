Resolution 20-553, effective July 14, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3956\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to approve the Amended and Restated\nBasic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal Year 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects\nContract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001E, including Task Order No. 001, between the District of\nColumbia government and HRGM Corporation, and to authorize payment to HRGM Corporation\nin the amount of $264,774 with a not-to exceed amount of $10 million for the goods and services\nreceived and to be received under this contract and task order.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cAmended and Restated Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal\nYear 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects Contract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001E,\nincluding Task Order No. 001, Approval and Payment Authorization Emergency Declaration\nResolution of 2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) There exists an immediate need to approve the Amended and Restated Basic\nOrdering Agreement for Fiscal Year 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects Contract\nNo. DCAM-14-CS-0001E, including Task Order No. 001, and to authorize payment to HRGM\nCorporation in the amount of $264,774 with a not to exceed amount of $10 million for the\ngoods and services received and to be received under this contract and task order.\n(b) Task Order No. 001 was issued pursuant to the Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal\nYear 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects Contract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001E\n(\u201cInitial Contract\u201d), which was competitively bid and issued with a minimum value of $50. As\nthe Initial Contract did not authorize any specific work or constitute a guarantee that any work\nwould be assigned to HRGM Corporation, no Council approval was required. Task Order No.\n001 was then issued for $264,774, and since the aggregate value of the Initial Contract and Task\nOrder No. 001 was less than $1 million, no Council approval was required.\n(c) Subsequently, the Initial Contract\u2019s terms and conditions were amended and restated,\nresulting in the issuance of the Amended and Restated Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal\nYear 2014 DCPS and DPR Small Construction Projects Contract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001E\n(\u201cContract\u201d) with an established not-to-exceed value of $10 million. All future work, if any,\nunder the Contract will be awarded and released through individual project task orders, based on\na competitive bidding process, as set forth in Section 1.2 of the Contract. Task orders may be\nissued up to the maximum not-to-exceed amount of $10 million, which will cause the aggregate\nvalue of the Contract and task order to exceed the $1 million threshold under section 451 of the\nDistrict of Columbia Home Rule Act, approved December 24, 1973 (87 Stat. 803; D.C. Official\nCode \u00a7 1-204.51).\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-900\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-393\n20 DCStat 3872\n\nAmended and\nRestated Basic\nOrdering\nAgreement for\nFiscal Year\n2014 DCPS\nand DPR\nSmall\nConstruction\nProjects\nContract No.\nDCAM-14CS-0001E,\nincluding\nTask Order\nNo. 001,\nApproval and\nPayment\nAuthorization\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-553, effective July 14, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3957\n\n(d) Approval of the Contract, including Task Order No. 001, in the amount of $264,774\nwith a not-to-exceed amount of $10 million is necessary to compensate HRGM Corporation for\nwork completed and to be completed pursuant to the Contract, including Task Order No. 001.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nAmended and Restated Basic Ordering Agreement for Fiscal Year 2014 DCPS and DPR Small\nConstruction Projects Contract No. DCAM-14-CS-0001E, including Task Order No. 001,\nApproval and Payment Authorization Emergency Act of 2014 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4.
