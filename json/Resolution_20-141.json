  "text": "COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-141, effective June 4, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 1560\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to prohibit the electric company from\nshutting off service when the heat index is forecasted to be 95 degrees Fahrenheit or above.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cHeat Wave Safety Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) There exists an immediate need to protect District residents who are\nvulnerable to health impairments that may be caused by periods of extreme heat and who may be\nunable to cool their homes if their electricity is shut off.\n(b) District law prohibits utilities from disconnecting service when the forecast predicts\nthat the temperature will be 32 degrees Fahrenheit or below during the following 24 hours.\n(c) Exposure to extreme heat is more likely than extreme cold to cause people to\nexperience negative health consequences, including death; yet, the District does not prohibit the\ndisconnection of electricity during or directly preceding periods of extreme heat analogous to the\nprohibition on disconnections during or directly preceding periods of extreme cold.\n(d) Enacting a prohibition on the disconnection of electricity during or directly preceding\nperiods of extreme heat will provide a measure of security for District residents without creating\nundue hardship for the electric company.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nHeat Wave Safety Emergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-304\nSee\nEmergency\nD.C. Act 20-83\n20 DCStat 1438\nHeat Wave\nSafety\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\f",
