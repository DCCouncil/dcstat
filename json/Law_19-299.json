Unless the terms of the\nextension preserve the secondary obligor\u2019s recourse, the extension correspondingly extends the\ntime for performance of any other duties owed to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor\nunder this article.\n\u201c(2) The secondary obligor is discharged to the extent that the extension would\notherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss.\n\u201c(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged under paragraph\n(2) of this subsection, the secondary obligor may:\n\u201c(A) Perform its obligations to a person entitled to enforce the instrument\nas if the time for payment had not been extended; or\n\u201c(B) Treat the time for performance of its obligations as having been\nextended correspondingly; except, that the time may not be treated as having been extended\ncorrespondingly if the terms of the extension permit the person entitled to enforce the instrument\nto retain the right to enforce the instrument against the secondary obligor as if the time for\npayment had not been extended.\n\u201c(c) If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to\na modification of the obligation of a principal obligor other than a complete or partial release or\nan extension of the due date and another party to the instrument is a secondary obligor with\nrespect to the obligation of that principal obligor, the following rules apply:\n\u201c(1) Any obligations of the principal obligor to the secondary obligor with respect\nto any previous payment by the secondary obligor are not affected. The modification\ncorrespondingly modifies any other duties owed to the secondary obligor by the principal obligor\nunder this article.\n\u201c(2) The secondary obligor is discharged from any unperformed portion of its\nobligation to the extent that the modification would otherwise cause the secondary obligor a loss.\n\u201c(3) To the extent that the secondary obligor is not discharged under paragraph\n(2) of this subsection, the secondary obligor may satisfy its obligation on the instrument as if the\nmodification had not occurred, or treat its obligation on the instrument as having been modified\ncorrespondingly.\n\u201c(d) If the obligation of a principal obligor is secured by an interest in collateral, another\nparty to the instrument is a secondary obligor with respect to that obligation, and a person\nentitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of\nthe secondary obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment.

Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, consent by the principal obligor to an act\nthat would lead to a discharge under this section constitutes consent to that act by the secondary\nobligor if the secondary obligor controls the principal obligor or deals with the person entitled to\nenforce the instrument on behalf of the principal obligor.\n\u201c(g) A release or extension preserves a secondary obligor\u2019s recourse if the terms of the\nrelease or extension provide that:\n\u201c(1) The person entitled to enforce the instrument retains the right to enforce the\ninstrument against the secondary obligor; and\n\u201c(2) The recourse of the secondary obligor continues as if the release or extension\nhad not been granted.\n\u201c(h) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (i) of this section, a secondary obligor\nasserting discharge under this section has the burden of persuasion both with respect to the\noccurrence of the acts alleged to harm the secondary obligor and loss or prejudice caused by\nthose acts.\n\u201c(i) If the secondary obligor demonstrates prejudice caused by an impairment of its\nrecourse, and the circumstances of the case indicate that the amount of loss is not reasonably\nsusceptible of calculation or requires proof of facts that are not ascertainable, it is presumed that\nthe act impairing recourse caused a loss or impairment equal to the liability of the secondary\nobligor on the instrument. In that event, the burden of persuasion as to any lesser amount of the\nloss is on the person entitled to enforce the instrument.\u201d.\nSec. 6.

Form of warehouse receipt; effect of omission.\n\u201c(a) A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.\n\u201c(b) Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse is\nliable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission:\n\u201c(1) A statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are\nstored;\n\u201c(2) The date of issue of the receipt;\n\u201c(3) The unique identification code of the receipt;\n\u201c(4) A statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a\nnamed person, or to its order;\n\u201c(5) The rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a\nfield warehousing arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on a\nnonnegotiable receipt;\n\u201c(6) A description of the goods or the packages containing them;\n\u201c(7) The signature of the warehouse or its agent;\n\u201c(8) If the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owns, either solely,\njointly, or in common with others, a statement of the fact of that ownership; and\n\u201c(9) A statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for\nwhich the warehouse claims a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances\nmade or liabilities incurred, at the time of the issue of the receipt, is unknown to the warehouse\nor to its agent that issued the receipt, in which case a statement of the fact that advances have\nbeen made or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or liabilities is sufficient.\n\u201c(c) A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to this subtitle\nand do not impair its obligation of delivery under \u00a7 28:7-403 or its duty of care under \u00a7 28:7204.

Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehouse\u2019s liability.\n\u201c(a) A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its\nfailure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise\nunder similar circumstances. Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages\nthat could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.\n\u201c(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement\nlimiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not\nliable. Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse\u2019s liability for conversion\nto its own use. On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement\nor within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse\u2019s liability may\nbe increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse\nreceipt. In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the\ngoods.\n\u201c(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and\ncommencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage\nagreement.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-205. Title under warehouse receipt defeated in certain cases.\n\u201cA buyer in ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a\nwarehouse that is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes the goods free of\nany claim under a warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been duly\nnegotiated.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-206. Termination of storage at warehouse's option.\n\u201c(a) A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held\nand any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any\ncharges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage\nfixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than 30\ndays after the warehouse gives notice. If the goods are not removed before the date specified in\nthe notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to \u00a7 28:7-210.\n\u201c(b) If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in\nvalue to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section\nand \u00a7 28:7-210, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection (a) of this\nsection any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed,\nmay sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.\n\u201c(c) If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not\nhave notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse\nfacilities, or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without\nadvertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-204\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-205\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-206\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.

If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose\nof them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.\n\u201c(d) A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this article\nupon due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.\n\u201c(e) A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under\nthis section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the\nwarehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-207. Goods must be kept separate; fungible goods.\n\u201c(a) Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separate\nthe goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of those\ngoods. However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.\n\u201c(b) If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common\nby the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that\nowner's share. If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the\nreceipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled to the fungible goods include all\nholders to which overissued receipts have been duly negotiated.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-208. Altered warehouse receipts.\n\u201cIf a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority,\na good-faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treat the\ninsertion as authorized. Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic\nwarehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-209. Lien of warehouse.\n\u201c(a) A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse\nreceipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage\nor transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor, or other charges,\npresent or future, in relation to the goods, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the\ngoods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law. If the person on whose account the\ngoods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever\ndeposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for\ncharges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods\ncovered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its\npossession for those charges and expenses, whether or not the other goods have been delivered\nby the warehouse. However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly\nnegotiated, a warehouse\u2019s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the\nwarehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the\nspecific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.\n\u201c(b) A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum\namount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection (a) of this\nsection, such as for money advanced and interest. The security interest is governed by Article 9.\n\u201c(c) A warehouse\u2019s lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) of this section or a\nsecurity interest under subsection (b) of this section is also effective against any person that so\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-207\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-208\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-209\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.

However, the lien or security interest is not\neffective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a\nperfected security interest in the goods and did not:\n\u201c(1) Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to\nthe bailor or the bailor\u2019s nominee with:\n\u201c(A) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;\n\u201c(B) Power to obtain delivery under \u00a7 28:7-403; or\n\u201c(C) Power of disposition under \u00a7 28:2-403, 28:2A-304, 28:2A-305 28:9320, or 28:9-321(c) or other statute or rule of law; or\n\u201c(2) Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.\n\u201c(d) A warehouse\u2019s lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the\ngoods under subsection (a) of this section is also effective against all persons if the depositor was\nthe legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit. In this subsection, the term \u201chousehold\ngoods\u201d means furniture, furnishings, or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.\n\u201c(e) A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably\nrefuses to deliver.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-210.

The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the\nnature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any public sale. The fact that a better price\ncould have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected\nby the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a\ncommercially reasonable manner.\n\u201c(2) The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse\nsells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in\nthat market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable\npractices among dealers in the type of goods sold.\n\u201c(3) A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure\nsatisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by\nparagraph (2) of this subsection.\n\u201c(b) A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in\nthe course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:\n\u201c(1) All persons known to claim an interest in the goods must be notified.\n\u201c(2) The notification must include an itemized statement of the claim, a\ndescription of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not\nless than 10 days after receipt of the notification, and a conspicuous statement that unless the\nclaim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a\nspecified time and place.\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-210\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.

The advertisement must include a description of the\ngoods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held, and the time and place\nof the sale. The sale must take place at least 15 days after the first publication.

In\nthat case, \u201cshipper's weight\u201d or words of similar import are ineffective.\n\u201c(d) The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words \u201cshipper's weight,\nload, and count\u201d, or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the\nshipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper\nloading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by\nimproper loading.\n\u201c(e) A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the\ndescription, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition, and weight, as furnished by the\nshipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in\nthose particulars. This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer\u2019s responsibility or liability\nunder the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-302. Through bills of lading and similar documents of title.\n\u201c(a) The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying an\nundertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is\nliable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other\nperson or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document. However, to\nthe extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in\nterritory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters\nother than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier\nmay be varied by agreement of the parties.\n\u201c(b) If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an\nundertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person,\nthe person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession,\nto the obligation of the issuer. The person\u2019s obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to\nanother person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability for breach by\nany other person or by the issuer.\n\u201c(c) The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in\nsubsection (a) of this section is entitled to recover from the performing carrier, or other person in\npossession of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document\noccurred:\n\u201c(1) The amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the\nbill or other document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment, or\ntranscript of judgment; and\n\nAmend\n\u00a7 28:7-302\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.

However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's\nlien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a\nreasonable charge.\n\u201c(b) A lien for charges and expenses under subsection (a) of this section on goods that the\ncarrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any\nperson entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to\nsubject the goods to those charges and expenses. Any other lien under subsection (a) of this\nsection is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control\nor possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.\n\u201c(c) A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably\nrefuses to deliver.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-308.

The notification must include\na statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale, and the time and place of any\npublic sale. The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or\nin a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that\nthe sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\u201c(2) The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier\nsells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in\nthat market at the time of the sale, or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable\npractices among dealers in the type of goods sold.\n\u201c(3) A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure\nsatisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by\nparagraph (2) of this subsection.\n\u201c(b) Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods\nmay pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in\ncomplying with this section.

Duty of care; contractual limitation of carrier's liability.\n\u201c(a) A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall\nexercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would\nexercise under similar circumstances. This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation, or\nrule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its\nnegligence.\n\u201c(b) Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation\nagreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation\nagreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an\nopportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity. However,\nsuch a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own\nuse.\n\u201c(c) Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and\ncommencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation\nagreement.\n\u201c Part 4.

Delivery without indorsement: right to compel indorsement.\n\u201cThe transferee of a negotiable tangible document of title has a specifically enforceable\nright to have its transferor supply any necessary indorsement, but the transfer becomes a\nnegotiation only as of the time the indorsement is supplied.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-507. Warranties on negotiation or delivery of document of title.\n\u201cIf a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, other than as a mere\nintermediary under \u00a7 28:7-508, unless otherwise agreed, the transferor, in addition to any\nwarranty made in selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only that:\n\u201c(1) The document is genuine;\n\u201c(2) The transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair the\ndocument\u2019s validity or worth; and\n\u201c(3) The negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect to the\ntitle to the document and the goods it represents.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-508.

If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the\ngoods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant\u2019s posting of security unless it\nfinds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of\nthe document is adequately protected against the loss. If the document was nonnegotiable, the\ncourt may require security. The court may also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs\nand attorney\u2019s fees in any action under this subsection.\n\u201c(b) A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming a missing\nnegotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby. If the delivery is not in good\nfaith, the bailee is liable for conversion. Delivery in good faith is not conversion if the claimant\nposts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of\nposting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery which files a notice of claim within one\nyear after the delivery.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-602. Judicial process against goods covered by negotiable document of title.\n\u201cUnless a document of title was originally issued upon delivery of the goods by a person\nthat did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial\nprocess to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is\noutstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee or the\ndocument\u2019s negotiation is enjoined. The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goods\npursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee or to\nthe court. A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process or injunction\ntakes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-603. Conflicting claims; interpleader.\n\u201cIf more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused\nfrom delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claims\nor to commence an action for interpleader. The bailee may assert an interpleader either in\ndefending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by original action.\n\u201cPart 7. Miscellaneous Provisions.\n\u201c\u00a7 28:7-701.
