Resolution 20-576, effective July 14, 2014\n\n20 DCSTAT 3993\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to declare the sense of the Council\nregarding the enforcement of the Marijuana Possession Decriminalization Amendment Act of\n2014 in the District of Columbia.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cSense of the Council of the District of Columbia Regarding\nEnforcement of the Marijuana Decriminalization Act Emergency Declaration Resolution of\n2014\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) Representative Andy Harris (R-MD) filed an amendment in the United\nStates House of Representatives that would prohibit implementation of the District\u2019s marijuana\ndecriminalization law - effectively stopping recent legislation that has completed congressional\nreview.\n(b) This resolution would express the Council\u2019s staunch opposition to attempts to\noverride our marijuana laws, which were adopted with strong Council and community support.\n(c) Our medical marijuana law passed overwhelmingly by voter initiative and we\nproceeded with implementation after Congress gave us a green light some 5 years ago.\n(d) Our decriminalization law is much more recent and follows the trend in what soon\nwill be a majority of the States. Both are good public policy.\nSec. 3 The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Sense\nof the Council of the District of Columbia Regarding Enforcement of the Marijuana\nDecriminalization Act Emergency Resolution of 2014 be adopted on an emergency basis.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-961\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
