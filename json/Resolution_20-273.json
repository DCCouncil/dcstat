  "text": "COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-273, effective September 17, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2660\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency, due to Congressional review, with respect to the need to exempt\nfrom taxation certain property owned or leased by YMCA of Metropolitan Washington or YMCA\nCommunity Investment Initiative, nonprofit organizations.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cYMCA Community Investment Initiative Real Property Tax\nExemption Congressional Review Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\".\n\nSec. 2. (a) Young Men\u2019s Christian Association of Metropolitan Washington (\u201cYMCA\u201d),\na tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, is the tenant under a long-term lease (\u201cLease\u201d) with the\nYMCA Community Investment Initiative (\u201cYMCA CII\u201d) Anthony Bowen YMCA located at\n1325 W Street, N.W., described as Lot 2010, Square 234 in Ward 1.\n(b) YMCA closed on permanent financing for the new Anthony Bowen YMCA through\nthe New Markets Tax Credit (\u201cNMTC\u201d) program, administered by the U.S. Treasury\nDepartment.\n(c) The NMTC program requires that the borrower must own the property being\nfinanced. For this reason, YMCA has formed a subsidiary, YMCA Community Investment\nInitiative, to be the borrower. At closing on the NMTC financing, YMCA will assign its interest\nin the Lease to the YMCA subsidiary, which will immediately sublease the property to YMCA.\n(d) YMCA is currently exempt from District of Columbia real property, possessory\ninterest, recordation, and transfer taxes with respect to the YMCA subsidiary. However, the\nYMCA subsidiary is not.\n(e) Without real property, possessory interest, transfer, and recordation tax exemptions\nfor the YMCA subsidiary, the YMCA would be forced to incur enormous, unanticipated taxes\nin connection with the NMTC loan transition.\n(f) D.C. Official Code \u00a7 47-1024 expressly states that \u201c[a]ll property belonging to the\nYoung Men\u2019s Christian Association of the District of Columbia, used and occupied by that\nAssociation, shall, so long as the same is so owned and occupied, be exempt from taxation,\nnational and municipal...\u201d.\n(g) The financing transaction, for the purposes of utilizing federal credits, is wholly\nconsistent with the intent of that statute.\n(h) YMCA will not profit from the NMTC structure described above. The only reason\nfor this structure is because it is required under the NMTC program.\n(i) YMCA currently owns the YMCA subsidiary property and thus is exempt from real\nproperty, possessory interest, recordation, and transfer taxes with respect to the YMCA\nsubsidiary property.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-429\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-178\n20 DCStat 2433\n\nYMCA\nCommunity\nInvestment\nInitiative Real\nProperty Tax\nExemption\nCongressional\nReview\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-273, effective September 17, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2661\n\n(j) After the NMTC financing closes, YMCA will continue to own the YMCA\nsubsidiary and will operate the Anthony Bowen YMCA facility to carry out its charitable\nactivities in the U Street/Cardozo/Shaw neighborhoods and beyond.\n(k) The transaction is revenue neutral to the District as the property will continue to be\nowned, used, and controlled by YMCA, which would ordinarily benefit from the provisions of\nDistrict of Columbia Official Code \u00a7 47-1024.\n(l) Emergency legislation relating to this issue expired on August 26, 2013, and\ntemporary legislation to be approved by Congress is not projected to take effect until October\n21, 2013, resulting in the law.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nYMCA Community Investment Initiative Real Property Tax Exemption Congressional Review\nEmergency Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
