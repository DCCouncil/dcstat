  "text": "COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-379, effective December 17, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 3075\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the Firearms Control\nRegulations Act of 1975 to extend to January 1, 2016, the date for implementation of the\nmicrostamping requirement for semiautomatic pistols.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cMicrostamping Implementation Emergency Declaration\nResolution of 2013\u201d.\nSec. 2. (a) D.C. Law 17-372, the Firearms Registration Amendment Act of 2008, added\nto the firearms law a requirement that newly-manufactured semiautomatic pistols be\n\u201cmicrostamp-ready.\u201d\n(b) Microstamping creates microscopic markings on a cartridge after a firearm is fired\nthat identify the make, model, and serial number of the firearm, allowing law enforcement to\nidentify a firearm the first time it is used in a crime.\n(c) In 2007, California became the first state to require microstamping on all new\nmodels sold in the state.\n(d) The District\u2019s microstamping requirement was initially to be implemented in 2011,\nin order to incorporate best practices learned from California\u2019s experience. However, D.C. Law\n18-377, the Criminal Code Amendment Act of 2010, delayed the applicability date from\nJanuary 1, 2011, until January 1, 2013. At that time, California had only recently issued\nregulations on microstamping. Because California was only beginning to put microstamping\ninto practice, the Council voted to delay the District\u2019s implementation in order to allow the\nmodel being developed in California to be further refined.\n(e) D.C. Law 19-170, the Firearms Amendment Act of 2012, again delayed\u2014to January\n1, 2014\u2014implementation of microstamping in the District after the process faced further delay\nin California due to patents on the technology. Implementation was postponed because of the\nvery small nature of the District\u2019s market. The view was that once California, a much larger\nmarket, implements microstamping, it would become more feasible for implementation in the\nDistrict.\n(f) This year, the patent issues were resolved and the law went into effect in California.\nBecause California is only now beginning to implement the microstamping requirements, for the\nsame reasons as stated above, it is necessary to again delay the implementation of the District\u2019s\nmicrostamping requirement to allow for more time for the requirement and implementation to\ntake hold in California.\n(g) The law must be amended now to delay the implementation requirement from\nJanuary 1, 2014, to January 1, 2016, given that the current implementation date is approaching.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-594\nSee Emergency\nD.C. Act 20-261\n20 DCStat 3024\nMicrostamping\nImplementatio\nn Emergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-379, effective December 17, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 3076\n\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the\nMicrostamping Implementation Emergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single\nreading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
