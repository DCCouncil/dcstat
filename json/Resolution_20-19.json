The Council finds that:\n(1) District residents pay approximately $4 billion in federal taxes each year,\nyet have no voting representation in Congress.\n(2) In 2000, the District, under the leadership of then-Council Chairman Linda\nCropp, added the phrase \u201cTaxation Without Representation\u201d to official, standard District of\nColumbia motor vehicle license plates.\n(3) President Bill Clinton displayed these official license plates, including the\nphrase \u201cTaxation Without Representation\u201d on his limousine.\n(4) President George W. Bush replaced these official license plates with an\nalternate design that omits the phrase \u201cTaxation Without Representation.\u201d President Barack\nObama has continued that practice, and his limousine\u2019s license plates omit this phrase.\n(5) Just a few weeks ago, DC Vote created a petition on the White House\u2019s\nwebsite asking President Obama to display the phrase \u201cTaxation Without Representation\u201d on his\nPresidential limousine\u2019s license plates. Already more than 22,000 people have signed the\npetition.\n(6) Over 600,000 people live in the District. The District\u2019s population is larger\nthan that of Wyoming and Vermont, which have full representation in Congress.\n(7) District residents pay the highest per capita federal income taxes in the\ncountry, fight in America\u2019s wars, and serve on its juries, yet they have no voting representation\nin Congress.\n(8) The District has 120 vibrant neighborhoods, each with its own rich, distinct\ncultural heritage.\n(9) The District is the only capital of a democratic country in the world that has no\nvoting representation in its national legislature.\n(10) Polls show that the majority of Americans are not aware that District\nresidents lack voting representation in Congress.\n(11) Displaying the phrase, \u201cTaxation Without Representation,\u201d is a singularly\neffective way of informing our fellow citizens of how fundamentally unfair and undemocratic it\nis that District residents do not have a representative in Congress who can vote.\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.
