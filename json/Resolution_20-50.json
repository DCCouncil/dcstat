Law 12-152; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 1-1901.01 et seq.).\n(c) The Act would deem the replacement plan described in the current law a\n\u201cgovernmental plan\u201d as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, and it would also deem that\nbenefits provided from the replacement plan be considered governmental plan benefits\nmaintained by the District.\n(d) Further, the Act would require that any benefits of the retirement program that are\nassigned or alienated be expressly permitted by the law and substantially meet all the\nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code as determined solely by the District of Columbia\nRetirement Board.\n(e) If the District is found to have failed to comply with these changes, which took effect\nDecember 31, 2011, it is subject to penalties and sanctions by the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nProposed Resolution\n20-115\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C.
