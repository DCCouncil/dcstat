The Council finds that:\n(1) The District is particularly grateful for the sacrifice of its veterans,\nappreciates the high-quality of medical care that District veterans have access to within the\nDistrict, and therefore believes all veterans should have access to high-quality medical care\nclose to where they reside.\n(2) New Hampshire has approximately 131,000 veterans, with the majority over\nthe age of 65, who served their country bravely and risked their lives to preserve our country\u2019s\nfreedom and democracy. Their sacrifices on our behalf are deserving of an upgraded medical\ndelivery system to meet their healthcare needs.\n(3) New Hampshire is a largely rural state, with limited access to the interstate\nhighway system, requiring veterans who may be ill and elderly and reside in rural communities\nto travel many miles to appointments for even minor medical procedures.\n(4) Many New Hampshire veterans over the age of 65 do not have access to a\nprimary care provider to support their medical needs.\n(5) Due to limited access to interstate highways, inclement weather, and lack of\nproper transportation in rural communities, many veterans miss essential checkups and\ntherapies.\n(6) Receiving timely medical treatment would improve the overall health and\nquality of life of veterans by preventing numerous strokes, by-passes, amputations, and other\ncostly, but preventable conditions.\n(7) Due to the lack of a full-service veterans\u2019 hospital in New Hampshire, many\nveterans are required to travel to Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, and Rhode Island for medical\ntreatment.\n(8) Veterans residing in rural communities deserve the same level of care as\nveterans residing in other areas of the states.\n(9) Adequate and high-quality care of all veterans should be a concern to all\nAmericans.\n\nSense of the\nCouncil on\nSupport of\nComprehensive\nHealth Care\nDelivery for\nNew\nHampshire\u2019s\nVeterans\nResolution of\n2014\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C.
