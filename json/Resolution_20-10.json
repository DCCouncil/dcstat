Resolution 20-10, effective January 8, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 702\n\nA RESOLUTION\n\nProposed Resolution\n20-39\n\nTo declare the existence of an emergency, due to Congressional review, with respect to the need to amend\nthe Department of Transportation Establishment Act of 2002 to authorize the District Department\nof Transportation (\u201cDDOT\u201d) to administer the Federal Transit Administration 5310 grant\nprogram to provide nonprofit organizations with vehicles to transport elderly and residents with\ndisabilities within the District, to allow participating organizations to deposit funds into the\nDistrict Department of Transportation Enterprise Fund for Transportation Initiatives to be\neligible to participate in the program, and to allow DDOT to use the funds deposited into the\nDistrict Department of Transportation Enterprise Fund for Transportation Initiatives by the\nparticipating nonprofit organizations toward the purchase of the vehicles.\n\nSee Emergency Act\nD.C. Act 20-7\n20 DCSTAT 456\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cDistrict Department of Transportation Accessible Vehicles\nFund Congressional Review Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nDistrict Department\nof Transportation\nAccessible Vehicles\nFund Congressional\nReview Emergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of 2013\n\nSec. 2. The District Department of Transportation (\u201cDDOT\u201d) needs authority to enter into\nagreements with nonprofit organizations and District government agencies to provide van and bus\naccess to elderly residents and residents with disabilities through a program known as \u201cthe 5310\nProgram.\u201d The 5310 Program will not cost the District any money, as 80% of the funds for the\nvehicles will come from the Federal Transit Administration, and the remaining 20% will come from\nlocal nonprofit organizations and District government agencies that will operate the vehicles. This\nprogram has been delayed because DDOT lacks authority to accept the 20% portion of the cost of\nthe vehicles from the nonprofit organizations and has no authority to enter into a contract with the\nnonprofit organizations. Because of this obstacle, DDOT has been unable to engage eligible\nnonprofit organizations that have the funds to participate in the program. As a result, the Federal\nTransit Administration is threatening to eliminate funding for this program. To avoid loss of funds\nand to provide improved access for elderly residents and residents with disabilities without delay,\nthis emergency legislation is necessary. Furthermore, this Congressional review emergency\nlegislation is necessary to prevent a gap between when the emergency, temporary, and permanent\nversions of this legislation become effective.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the District\nDepartment of Transportation Accessible Vehicles Fund Congressional Review Emergency\nAmendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
