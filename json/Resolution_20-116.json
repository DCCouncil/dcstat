  "text": "COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-116, effective May 7, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 1526\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency, due to Congressional review, with respect to the need to amend\nsection 47-462 of the District of Columbia Official Code to extend the deadline for the final report\nof the Tax Revision Commission; to amend the Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010 to\nallow the Tax Revision Commission to procure goods and services independent of the Chief\nProcurement Officer pursuant to a streamlined small-purchase procurement process for contracts\nfor goods and services not exceeding $40,000.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this\nresolution may be cited as the \u201cTax Revision Commission Report Extension and Procurement\nStreamlining Congressional Review Emergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. (a) The purpose of the Tax Revision Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) is to conduct a\nbroad and deep review of the District\u2019s tax laws, tax expenditures, revenues, tax base, and economy,\nand to provide the Council and the Mayor with recommendations for reform. The Commission is\nrequired by law to submit its recommendations in the form of a report or reports similar in form and\nscope as those transmitted by the District of Columbia Tax Revision Commission in 1998.\n(b) Under current law (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 47-462(d)), the Commission was given just 9\nmonths to produce its report and recommendations.\n(c) The original Commission required 2 years between passage of the legislation and the\npublication of its well-researched and in-depth report in 1998.\n(d) The members of the Commission are of the opinion that an extension of the time for the\nCommission to publish its report and recommendations would result in a publication of both depth\nand breadth comparable to the 1998 report and which would better inform policy decisions in the\ncoming years. This will provide the Commission with the necessary time to commission studies\nexternally and produce the best and most thoughtful product.\n(e) The work of the Commission will be most effective if the deadline for the report is\nextended to the end of fiscal year 2013, or September 30, 2013.\n(f) The Commission has experienced difficulty in attempting to execute quick\nprocurements for expert research into particular topics of tax law and policy. With the reporting\ndeadline approaching, the Commission has an urgent need for expedited contracting.\n(g) Exempting certain procurements from the requirements of the Procurement Practices\nReform Act of 2010, effective April 8, 2011 (D.C. Law 18-371; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 2-351.01 et\nseq.), will allow the Commission to accomplish its statutory mandate within the deadline set\nforth in the Tax Revision Commission Report Extension and Procurement Streamlining\nEmergency Amendment Act of 2013.\n(h) The Tax Revision Commission Report Extension and Procurement Streamlining\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-247\nSee\nEmergency\nD.C. Act 20-67\n20 DCStat 1417\n\nTax Revision\nCommission\nReport\nExtension and\nProcurement\nStreamlining\nCongressional\nReview\nEmergency\nDeclaration\nResolution of\n2013\n\n\fCOUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nD.C. Resolution 20-116, effective May 7, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 1527\n\nEmergency Amendment Act of 2013 would allow the Commission to procure goods and services\nindependent of the Chief Procurement Officer pursuant to a streamlined small-purchase\nprocurement process for contracts for goods and services not exceeding $40,000. Limiting the\nCommission\u2019s independent procurement authority to contracts of such a small amount will\nensure that the District\u2019s policy of favoring competitive procurements is not undermined.\n(i) The Council adopted the Tax Revision Commission Report Extension and\nProcurement Streamlining Emergency Amendment Act of 2013, effective March 1, 2013 (D.C.\nAct 20-19; 60 DCR 3974), and the Tax Revision Commission Report Extension and\nProcurement Streamlining Temporary Amendment Act of 2013, effective March 20, 2013 (D.C.\nAct 20-40; 60 DCR 4667) earlier this year. The emergency legislation is set to expire on May\n30, 2013, and the temporary measure is still undergoing the Congressional review period and is\nnot projected to become law until June 3, 2013. Thus, this Congressional review emergency is\nnecessary to prevent a gap in the law.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances\nenumerated in section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Tax\nRevision Commission Report Extension and Procurement Streamlining Congressional Review\nEmergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a single reading.\nSec. 4. This resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\n\f",
