Resolution 20-190, effective June 26, 2013\n\n20 DCSTAT 2021\n\nA RESOLUTION\nTo declare the existence of an emergency with respect to the need to amend the Washington Metropolitan\nArea Transit Authority Board of Directors Act of 2012 to change the initial appointment date of\nBoard of Director appointments from July 1, 2013, to January 2, 2014.\n\nRESOLVED, BY THE COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, That this resolution\nmay be cited as the \u201cWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board of Directors\nEmergency Declaration Resolution of 2013\u201d.\n\nSec. 2. Section 2 of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Board of\nDirectors Act of 2012, effective April 27, 2013 (D. C. Law 19-286; D.C. Official Code \u00a7 91108.11), requires that initial appointments to the Board of Directors be done on July 1, 2013.\nAs no appointments have yet been introduced, there is insufficient time to complete the full\nCouncil process and meet the current statutory mandate. This emergency will change the initial\nappointment date from July 1, 2013, to January 2, 2014, in order to allow sufficient time to\nproperly vet appointees to the board.\nSec. 3. The Council of the District of Columbia determines that the circumstances enumerated\nin section 2 constitute emergency circumstances making it necessary that the Washington Metropolitan\nArea Transit Authority Board of Directors Emergency Amendment Act of 2013 be adopted after a\nsingle reading.\nSec. 4. The resolution shall take effect immediately.\n\nProposed\nResolution\n20-357\nSee Emergency\nD.C.
