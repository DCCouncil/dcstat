        <p>To ensure the authenticity of the documents included on this page, the Council is currently using two methods:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>SSL/TLS</strong>. A secure method ensuring that transmission of website data requested by a user has not been changed.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>SHA Hash Values</strong>. Using a cryptographic algorithm (SHA-256), a unique value is calculated based on the contents of a particular file. If the file has been altered in any way, the computed value will be different.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the coming weeks, the Council will fully implement its new Authentication Service that will allow for Digital Signatures and will allow a user to upload a file to check whether the file is valid. </p>
