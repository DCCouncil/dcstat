        <p>As part of the Council's commitment to ensure that official electronic legal materials are preserved, the Council has uploaded the Council Period 20 DCSTAT (as well as historical versions from 1975 through 1986) to the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. The files can be <a href="/">accessed here</a>.</p>

        <p>To ensure the authenticity of the documents included on this page, the Council is currently using two methods:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>SSL/TLS</strong>. A secure method ensuring that transmission of website data requested by a user has not been changed.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>SHA Hash Values</strong>. Using a cryptographic algorithm (SHA-256), a unique value is calculated based on the contents of a particular file. If the file has been altered in any way, the computed value will be different.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In the coming weeks, the Council will fully implement its new Authentication Service that will allow for Digital Signatures and will allow a user to upload a file to check whether the file is valid. </p>
