The files can be <a href="/">accessed here</a>.</p>

<a id="user-content-authentication" class="anchor" href="#authentication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authentication</h2>

<p>To ensure the authenticity of the documents included on this page, the Council is currently using two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<strong>SSL/TLS</strong>. A secure method ensuring that transmission of website data requested by a user has not been changed.</li>
<li>
<strong>SHA Hash Values</strong>. Using a cryptographic algorithm (SHA-256), a unique value is calculated based on the contents of a particular file. If the file has been altered in any way, the computed value will be different.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the coming weeks, the Council will fully implement its new Authentication Service that will allow for Digital Signatures and will allow a user to upload a file to check whether the file is valid. </p>
